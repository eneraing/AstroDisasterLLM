Subjects: Supernovae

We report on early NuSTAR observations of the Type Ia supernova in NGC 7331 (https://www.wis-tns.org/object/2025rbs) at a distance of 14.7 Mpc. We triggered a NuSTAR DDT, which resulted in an observation starting at 2025-07-20T07:36:27 and lasting a day of linear time with an exposure time of roughly 41-ks. This was six days after the classification report (Andrews et al., TNS 21522) and roughly 6 days prior to peak optical emission. 
 
 
We observed diffuse emission in the NuSTAR images in the 3-20 keV band covering the central ~arcmin of the galaxy, including the nominal source position for SN 2025rbs. Inspection of archival NuSTAR images in the same band from 2020 shows the majority of the emission is dominated at that time by a single point source. However, there are a number of potentially variable sources in the Chandra and XMM source catalogs that are spatially coincident with the NuSTAR emission. For example, the nearby Chandra source noted in archival data from Kong et al. (ATEL #17287). 
 
 
We extract a NuSTAR spectrum from a 30-arcsec region centered on the coordinates for SN 2025rbs. We find that the resulting spectra appears to be soft in the 3-20 keV NuSTAR spectra. Fitting both of the FPMA and FPMB modules simultaneously, we find that the resulting source spectra are incompatible with a hard (gamma=1.4) absorbed power-law. Allowing the power-law index to vary results in an unphysically steep index (Gamma>4). If we instead adopt an absorbed diskbb component, we find a reasonably good fit using an unabsorbed disk component with a relatively high temperature (2.4 keV). Either case is likely an incorrect physical model, but provides a reasonable phenomenological fit to the data. The 3-10 keV (absorbed) flux is 2.1 Â± 1.0e-13 ergs / cm2 / sec in the 3-10 keV, which corresponds to a 3-10 keV luminosity of a roughly 5e39 ergs at a distance of 14.7 Mpc. This seems relatively high for a single X-ray binary in NGC 7331, but this may be the superposition of several active transient sources at once that are blended by the ~1-arcmin NuSTAR HPD. We conclude that we cannot positively identify the soft X-ray emission as being associated with SN 2025rbs.  
 
 
We also inspect the NuSTAR images for any evidence of high-energy emission from the supernovae. We do not find evidence for a source in the 40-80 keV images. Net counts (both telescopes) from a 30-arcsec source region centered on the source was 82 counts, while the expectation from the background regions was 84 counts. 25 additional source counts would have been required for a 3-sigma detection. Assuming an average effective area of 20 cm2 in the 40-80 keV (both telescopes combined) results in an upper limit on the source flux of roughly 3e-5 ph / cm2 / sec in this band. 
 
 
We thank the NuSTAR Science Operations team for a speedy scheduling of this observation and encourage additional soft X-ray follow-up observations to attempt to resolve the origin of the soft X-ray emission."

We report evidence for a shift in the powering mechanism of the Type II SN 2023ixf, discovered on MJD 60083 in the M101 galaxy at 6.4 Mpc (Perley et al. 2023). We observed the event ~2 years after discovery, at MJD 60797, 60798, 60854 with the Silicon Fast Photometer and Polarimeter (SiFAP2; Meddi et al. 2012, Ghedina et al. 2018) and at MJD 60870, 60877 with the Swift Ultra Violet Optical Telescope (UVOT; Roming et al. 2005).

SiFAP2 clearly detects a point-source at the location of SN 2023ixf in all observed epochs. Photon count rates were converted into V-band magnitudes after background subtraction and calibration using standard curves. We report the following preliminary results:

UVOT does not detect a significant signal at the SN location in the U, B, or V bands. The limited exposure time (1265 s and 1665 s) and high background of the first map, possibly due to a bright transient event during the observations, limit the sensitivity of the UVOT images. A source is marginally detected in the coadded image with B = 18.54 +/- 0.14 and U = 18.76 +/- 0.08, while no detection is found in V > 18.79.

Assuming a radioactive decay-powered light curve, we would expect the magnitude to be under the sensitivity limit of our telescope, at V > 22 mag. However, the observed brightness exceeds this expectation, suggesting an additional energy input is sustaining the luminosity at late times. This deviation is consistent with a transition to interaction-powered emission, likely driven by ongoing ejectaâcircumstellar material (CSM) interaction (Jacobson-GalÃ¡n, W. V. 2025). The photometric evolution between MJD 60798 and MJD 60854 shows no significant fading (dV = â0.18 +/-  0.44 mag), further supporting a flattening of the light curve that is inconsistent with Co-56 decay alone.

Additional Swift-UVOT observations are already scheduled. We encourage further multi-wavelength follow-up observations to monitor the ongoing evolution of the source and to constrain the nature of its late-time emission better."

We report the detection of a small glitch event in the timing data of the Crab pulsar (PSR B0531+21), which we monitor as part of the Jodrell Bank Pulsar Timing Programme. The Crab pulsar is observed daily with the 42-ft telescope using a 4 MHz wide band centred on 610 MHz. Additional short observations are carried out with the Lovell telescope using a 384 MHz wide band centred on 1532 MHz. This glitch is the 31st such event observed in this pulsar and occurred on 2025 July 17; ~6 years after the previous glitch in 2019. Preliminary analysis indicates a fractional rotational spin-up of dF0/F0 = 2.33(9)E-09 and a fractional change to the spin-down rate of dF1/F1 = 0.43(4)E-03 (1 sigma uncertainties). We currently measure the glitch epoch to be MJD 60873.95(35). At present, we find no evidence of any post-glitch transient behaviour; however we continue our daily monitoring of the pulsar. Observations at other facilities are encouraged in order to confirm the glitch and refine the measured parameters."

We report the possible discovery of a supernova in NGC 7331 at a distance of 12 Mpc at UT 2025-07-20 07:30:00 (JD 2460876.81). This was done visually with the 60-inch telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory during one of their public observing sessions. The authors have observed NGC 7331 frequently using both the 60-inch and 100-inch telescopes and immediately recognized a bright point-source approximately 1 arc-minute North of the nucleus not seen previously. Approximate coordinates are 22h37m4s +34d25m55s. Unfortunately, we had no imaging equipment that could be used to determine a more precise position or magnitude. We visually estimate the point-source to be comparable or even brighter than the nucleus (V = 9.5). Observations are requested to verify the transient and determine a proper location and magnitude."

Following the discovery of the Type Ia supernova SN2025rbs in the nearby galaxy NGC 7331 (https://www.wis-tns.org/object/2025rbs), we have searched for X-ray emission of its progenitor with the Chandra Source Catalog (Evans et al. 2024). Based on the 13 Chandra observations of NGC 7331 taken between 2001 and 2020 (242 ks total observing time), an X-ray source in the Chandra Source Catalog, 2CXO J223703.6+342507,  is located at about 0.7 arcsec from the supernovaâs position. The 95% positional uncertainty of the X-ray source is 0.47 arcsec. Given the separation between the X-ray source and the supernova, we tentatively conclude that the X-ray progenitor was not detected.

The X-ray source 2CXO J223703.5+342507 is also in the NGC 7331 X-ray source catalog (Jin and Kong 2019) which is based on a 126 ks stacked Chandra image. It was classified as a low-mass X-ray binary according to the X-ray colours. The X-ray spectrum can be fitted with an absorbed power-law with a photon index of 1.85 and a 0.3-8 keV X-ray luminosity of 4.5e38 erg/s (D=14.7 Mpc). No optical counterpart was found from the Hubble Space Telescope observations.

The X-ray luminosity limit of the progenitor of SN2025rbs can be constrained to approximately 3.6e37 erg/s (0.3-8 keV), based on the X-ray detection threshold reported by Jin & Kong (2019). Further analysis incorporating more recent Chandra observations is currently underway to better constrain the X-ray emission from the progenitor of SN2025rbs."

We report the following classification of an optical transient from spectroscopic observations with the Kast spectrograph on the Shane telescope. The target was supplied by ATLAS. Observations were made on 2025 July 03 UT. Classification was performed with SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024).

Notes: 
When the redshift is given to 2 decimal places, it is derived from the SN spectrum.  Otherwise, the redshift is determined from the host galaxy.  
(1) The spectrum is highly contaminated by galaxy light.  SNID template fitting was performed after subtracting an SDSS host-galaxy template spectrum. The best-fit match was SN 1991bg at +16 days past peak brightness. The transient exhibits a red color at peak, an absolute B-band magnitude of approximately -18.4 mag, and a fast decline rate of Delta m15 (B) ~ 1.4 mag, all of which support a SN 1991bg-like subclassification."

We observed the X-ray transient EP250702a (GCN 40906), which is also associated with the multiple gamma-ray triggers designated as GRB 250702B/D/E (GCNs 40883, 40886, 40890, 40891, 40931, 40903, 40914, 40923), with the NuSTAR X-ray Telescope through a Target of Opportunity observation through GO program 11282 (PI: Pasham). The observation occurred between 2025-07-03 20:45:21 and 2025-07-04 09:15:00 UTC for an on-source exposure of ~21.5 ks, simultaneous with Swift/XRT observations (ObsID: 19906002).

The source is clearly detected at an average rate of ~0.4 cts/s. The 3-79 keV X-ray lightcurve shows short term variability throughout the full exposure in both FPMA and FPMB, but no flaring is observed. The source varies in count rate by a factor of 2-3 on timescales as short as a few ks. Compared to NuSTAR observations of GRB 221009A at a similar count rate (GCNs 32695, 32788), the source shows more significant variability, which we suggest disfavors an ultralong GRB origin, especially in conjunction with the July 1st onset reported by the Einstein Probe (GCN 40906).

The X-ray spectra are featureless and do not show any Fe lines or reflection features. This is consistent with the lack of features in the Swift/XRT spectra. The 3-79 keV spectrum (FPMA+FPMB) is well fit by an absorbed powerlaw with a photon index of Gamma~1.81+/-0.03, which is consistent with the initial Swift/XRT spectral index within errors (GCN 40919). The hydrogen column density was fixed to 1e22 cm^-2 as per the best-fit Swift/XRT spectra (see https://www.swift.ac.uk/LSXPS/transients/9377). The unabsorbed 3-79 keV flux (time-averaged) is (2.35+/-0.05)e-11 erg/cm^2/s during our observation.

We also performed a fit with an absorbed cutoff powerlaw and find a cutoff energy >60 keV. In this case, the best-fit photon index is Gamma~1.67+/-0.08. This has better agreement with the EP/FXT result, although the FXT observation was obtained at an earlier time (GCN 40917). The C-stat between both fits to the NuSTAR data was nearly identical and the cutoff powerlaw is not a statistically significant improvement. We suggest that the lack of Fe lines, and lack of cutoff in the powerlaw spectra (out to at least 60 keV), is atypical for an X-ray binary.

We performed a Lomb-Scargle analysis on the barycenter corrected X-ray data, and did not identify any periodic signals over the frequency range 1e-3 to 100 Hz, consistent with the EP/FXT report (GCN 40917). The periodogram becomes red noise dominated below 3e-3 Hz.

Further analysis is underway and additional NuSTAR and Swift observations are planned.

We thank the NuSTAR SOC, and in particular Karl Forster and Brian Grefenstette, for promptly implementing these observations."

Using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT), we report the detection of 10 bursts from repeating fast radio burst FRB 20250613A that was recently discovered by the ASKAP team (Atel #17257). Observations were carried out from 2:30 to 5:30 UTC at Band 3 (300 - 500 MHz) on 2025 July 02 and at Band 4 (550 - 750 MHz) on 2025 July 03 (2:30 to 5:30 UTC). The on-source time was 86 minutes at Band 3 and 123 minutes at Band 4. Filterbank data were recorded from a phased-array beam and searched using the TransientX pipeline above a S/N threshold of 8 and at a single DM of 174.6 pc cm^-3 (as reported by the ASKAP team; Atel #17257). A more comprehensive search using coherently dedispersed and high time resolution data, over a range of DMs, is currently underway. 
 
 
 
In Band 3 observations, we detected six bursts, with the emission in one of the bursts extending up to the lower edge of the band at 300 MHz. In Band 4 observations, we detected four bursts. Burst signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios range from 8 to 22 at Band 3 and from 11 to 44 at Band 4. Using the measured widths and S/N values from TransientX along with the radiometer equation, the burst fluences range from 0.5 to 2.5 Jy ms. The measured pulse-widths range between 1.5 ms and 22.3 ms. We also measured structure-optimised DMs of 174.72 +/- 0.09 and 174.75 +/- 0.12 pc cm^-3 for the brightest burst detected in Band 4 and Band 3, respectively, using DM_phase. 
 
 
 
Detection of these new bursts shows that the emission from FRB 20250613A extends to frequencies as low as 300 MHz, and confirms continued activity of the source. We encourage further multi-frequency monitoring and especially observations at even lower radio frequencies. 
 
 
 
We thank the observatory for prompt scheduling of our observations and the GMRT staff for their support. The GMRT is operated by the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.

Despite the similar position lying close to or on the galactic plane, we observe photons in the BGO up to 1 MeV, with the majority of the photons occurring in the 50-300 keV range, which suggest the source may not be a typical galactic source and might be an ultra-long GRB or another source class. If a GRB origin is confirmed, it is 11.5 ks long, making it one of the longest ultra-long GRBs detected. 
 
The combined GBM skymap can be found here: https://zenodo.org/records/15793558. The skymaps are all associated with each other with confidence between 89.2 and 98.5%.

We report the discovery of the new repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source, FRB 20250613A. FRB 20250613A was first identified as a single 12sigma burst with a dispersion measure (DM) of 174.6 pc cm^-3 on 2025 June 13 at 22:22 UTC. The burst was detected during a 10-hour observation for the Evolutionary Map of the Universe survey, using the incoherent sum search mode pipeline. We localised the burst to sub-arcsec precision (R.A. 04h36m33.04(5)s, Decl. -44d31m58.6(4)s) using triggered voltage data and our post processing pipeline (Scott et al. 2023). 
 
We identified a putative host of FRB 20250613A in the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey. The host was measured with an r-band magnitude of 22, and a photometric redshift z=0.22(9). Together with the DM, this implies that FRB 20250613A originates from a low-luminosity dwarf galaxy, with a luminosity <~ 4x10^9 L_sun. The initial burst shows band-limited emission and has multiple components (see attached figures) with complex time-frequency structure exhibiting downwards drifting ""sad trombone""-like features, which are typical features of repeating FRBs (Pleunis et al., 2021). We measure the rotation measure (RM) of -7162.3(9) rad m^-2: the fourth highest RM magnitude of all currently known FRBs. The high RM, spectro-temporal features, and dwarf host galaxy motivated prompt follow up to search for repetitions. 
 
We carried out two follow-up observations of FRB 20250613A with the MeerKAT radio telescope using the L-band (856-1712 MHz) receiving system: a 2-hour observation on 2025 June 23 starting at 05:26 UTC and a 6-hour observation on 2025 June 24 starting at 05:55 UTC, under the Director's Discretionary Time Proposal DDT-20250621-AW-01. We detected 16 additional bursts from FRB 20250613A during these observations using the real-time MeerTRAP pipeline (Rajwade et al. 2022), confirming its repeating nature. We are currently working on identifying more bursts in the data as the real time detection pipeline might have been affected by the presence of RFI.  
 
We combined the visibilities from all MeerKAT observations and performed calibration and imaging using oxkat (Heywood, 2020), and separately verified with processMeerKAT. We identified a radio source at the FRB location with a peak flux density of 24.2+/-5.1 uJy/beam. Further analysis is required to determine whether the emission originates from a persistent radio source or is associated with star formation in the host galaxy. 
Given that FRB 20250613A is likely still active, we encourage further observations.

We report the classifications of astrophysical transients from spectroscopic observations with the Kast spectrograph on the Shane telescope obtained on 2025 June 26 UT. The targets were supplied by ZTF and ALeRCE (selected from the ZTF data stream). Targets were identified using the target management platform YSE-PZ (Coulter et al., 2023, PASP, 135, 4501). The classifications were performed with SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024).

When the redshift is given to 2 decimal places, it is derived from the SN spectrum. Otherwise, the redshift is determined from the host galaxy. 
 
(1) SN2025mhx was previously classified as ""SN Ia-91T"" at z=0.05 by Terwel et al. (2025, TNSCR 2166). With a higher signal-to-noise spectrum and ~2 weeks of evolution, the object shows several spectral lines with absorption velocities more consistent with SNe Iax (~-6000 km/s). We find several matches to SNe Iax, including SN 2002cx, at z=0.04. 
(2) We subtract the 1-dimensional SDSS spectrum of the host and recover a spectrum with several SN Ia features. We measure a Si II 6355 velocity of -11,400 km/s. 
(3) The spectrum shows a blue and mostly featureless continuum with a weak broad emission line consistent with H alpha. 
(4) We measure a Si II 6355 velocity of -12,600 km/s.

On 2025-06-12T20:36:00 UTC (hereafter T0), SVOM/ECLAIRs triggered and located an X-ray transient (SVOM burst-id sb25061218) at R.A.(J2000)= 13h14m00.67s and Dec.(J2000)=54d39m29.47s (+/-11.16 arcmin @ 90% confidence, Rodriguez et al. GCN 40712).

During the observation of the event (exposure time = 80s),  the estimated average count rate is about 81 cts/s in the 4-120 keV energy band.  
A preliminary analysis of the (4-120 keV) ECLAIRs data shows the source has a power law like spectrum with a hard photon index Γ=1.5 +/-0.3 (90%) and a 4-120 keV flux of about 1e-8 erg/s/cm2.

In the X-rays, Swift observed the field between T0+5.9ks and T0+7.7ks. Two previously uncatalogued X-ray sources were detected with XRT within the ECLAIRs error box (Evans et al. GCN 40721). Both sources have very low 0.3-10 keV fluxes: ~5e-13 erg/s/cm2 and 1e-13 erg/s/cm2 for sources 1 and 2, respectively.

In Optical, the field was observed with various facilities. No sources were detected down to a 10-σ limit of i>23 with SVOM/Colibri between about T0+10hrs and T0+14hrs (Watson et al. GCN 40724).

The increase of the Optical flux two hours after the SVOM trigger renders the association of the SVOM trigger and the QSO tempting and possible, and in this case the SVOM trigger source would thus be the high-energy counterpart to [VV2006] J131446.6+544804 and Swift source n1, while in a period of enhanced multi-wavelength activity.

While the association of Swift source n1 with the quasar is very likely, the large differences of X-ray fluxes between SVOM and Swift are however puzzling in the context of transient QSO emission. We, thus, do not exclude that the SVOM trigger is a new unrelated X-ray transient source (SVOM J13140+5439), or a real GRB coincident by chance with a flare from [VV2006] J131446.6+544804. Under the latter interpretation, sb25061218 would be a rare example of an X-ray dark GRB.

Multi-wavelength follow-up of the field is encouraged.

The Space Variable Objects Monitor (SVOM) is a China-France joint mission led by the Chinese National Space Administration (CNSA, China), National Center for Space Studies (CNES, France) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS, China), which is dedicated to observing gamma-ray bursts and other transient phenomena in the energetic universe. ECLAIRs was developed jointly by APC, CEA, CNES and IRAP. MXT has been developed jointly by CNES, CEA, IJCLab, University of Leicester and MPE."

We report on follow-up radio observations to search for a possible persistent radio source (PRS) associated with FRB 20230607A. The latter is a repeater for which an intense bursting activity has been recently reported in Zhou et al. 2025 (arXiv: 2504.11173). Moreover, the bursts from this source presented a rotation measure (RM) of approximately −1.2 × 104 rad m-2 (Zhou et al. 2025). Given the large RM values and the expected relation between the RM and the persistent radio luminosity of a possible persistent counterpart associated with the FRB (Yang et al. 2022, Bruni et al. 2023), this source represents an ideal candidate to search for a PRS. 
 
We observed the field of FRB 20230607A with the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) using the band-5 (1050-1450 MHz) for a total of 4.3 h on 2025 May 27. The total bandwidth was splitted into 4096 channels, each of 97.7 kHz. The sources 3C48 and 2130+050 were used as absolute flux scale and phase calibrators, respectively. We carried out a standard interferometric data reduction using the Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA; McMullin et al. 2007) package. We then iteratively performed flagging of RFI, bandpass, amplitude and phase calibration. We finally performed a round of phase self-calibration. Imaging was carried out with WSClean (Offringa et al. 2014) by using various weighting schemes. We achieved a final noise level of 15 μJy beam-1 at an angular resolution of 2.5'' × 1.7'' (briggs weighting with robust 0). 
 
We searched for a compact continuum source around the fiducial localization coordinates of FRB 20230607A, being R.A. (J2000) = 21h53m35.0s, Dec. (J2000) = 11&compfn;17'04.20 '' (Zhou et al. 2025), within the 90&percnt; confidence level (C.L.) localization uncertainties, using σR.A. = 44.1'' and σDec. = 66.8'' (Zhou et al. 2025). We didn't detect any possible PRS for a S/N > 3 within the 90&percnt; C.L. localization region. Instead, there is a compact radio source within the 99&percnt; C.L. region having ≈ 100 ± 15 μJy flux density. Its coordinates are R.A. (J2000) = 21h53m33.556s ± 0.005s, Dec. (J2000) = 11&compfn;16'11.83'' ± 0.04 ''. Given that the FRB has not yet been associated with any host galaxy we cannot claim that this is the PRS of the source. Considering a non-detection, our flux density limit of 45 μJy beam-1 converts to an upper limit on the persistent radio luminosity at 1.26 GHz of 5.9 × 1028 erg s-1 Hz-1, when considering z = 0.22 as the redshift of FRB 20230607A (as estimated from the DM of FRB 20230607A, Zhou et al. 2025). Our 3σ luminosity limit is a factor of 2 deeper than the radio power of confirmed PRSs associated with FRBs 20121102A (Chatterjee et al. 2017) and 20190520B (Niu et al. 2022); nevertheless, the candidate PRS associated with FRB 20201124A (Bruni et al. 2023) has a radio power which is a factor 10 lower than our limit. The implications of our non-detection will be discussed in an upcoming paper.

Notes: 
When the redshift is given to 2 decimal places, it is derived from the SN spectrum. Otherwise, the redshift is determined from the host galaxy. 
(1) We measure a redshift of 0.0713 from a spectrum of the host galaxy, which differs from the NED-listed redshift that was inferred from a friends-of-friends procedure.  The spectrum matches well with SN 1991bg-like SNe Ia at a phase of about 18 days after peak at a redshift of 0.07, consistent with our spectroscopic redshift measurement. We measure a Si II 6355 velocity of -8,100 km/s.  
(2) The observed spectrum is particularly red, and assuming a typical blue spectrum for a young SN, the color can be attributed to dust reddening of E(B-V) ~ 1.2 mag.  The spectrum has broad spectral features consistent with that of a SN Ic-BL soon after peak brightness.  The ATLAS light curve is either still rising or at peak, and so we caution that the phase reported is likely biased by ~7 days.  Correcting for the derived reddening and a Hubble-flow distance accounting for Virgo inflow and the Great Attractor, we find an absolute magnitude of M_o = -19.0 mag, consistent with a SN Ic-BL before peak brightness."

We obtained deep imaging of the location of FRB 20250316A (ATels #17081, #17114) using NIRCam on the James Webb Space Telescope starting at 2025 May 19 at 13:55 UT.  Observations were taken with the extra-wide F150W2 and F322W2 filters, with the science exposure time in each filter totaling 2.6 hours.

We detect two faint point-like sources in the F150W2 filter at the edge of the 1-sigma error ellipse of the CHIME/Outrigger position of FRB 20250316A (ATel #17114).  The sources are not clearly detected in the F322W2 filter.  We measure the following preliminary photometry for the brighter of the two sources: m_F150W2 = 30.12 +/- 0.17 mag.  The second source is detected at roughly the level of the 5-sigma upper limit of m > 30.25 mag.

One of these sources may be an IR counterpart of FRB 20250316A, though given their location of ~0.12 arcsec from the nominal FRB position, it is also possible that a counterpart has not been detected.  At the distance of the host galaxy NGC 4141, the F150W2 upper limit corresponds to an approximate absolute magnitude upper limit of m > -2.75 mag.

Analysis of the field is ongoing.  We are working with the CHIME team to refine and improve the FRB position to match the JWST resolution."

XRISM/Xtend Transient Search (XTS) detected an X-ray brightening from an X-ray source XRISM J0918-1212 on 2025-05-06 TT. The source position is determined to be (R.A., Dec.) = (139.395, -12.200), with a systematic error of ∼ 40 arcsec. A plausible counterpart is the AGN candidate 2XMMi J091734.9-121159, which is located ∼ 2 arcsec apart from the position of XRISM J0918-1212. All statistical uncertainties in this report will be provided as a 90% confidence level unless stated otherwise.  
 
 
 
The flare started at 2025-05-06 at ~15:23 TT, reached its peak on 2025-05-06 at ∼ 20:40, and decayed on a scale of t(-0.9 +/-0.2).  
 
The peak flux is calculated as 6 × 10-13 erg s-1 cm-2 (0.4 – 10.0 keV). A systematic error of roughly 20% should be added to the statistical error. Corresponding luminosity is 3 × 1042 erg s-1 by assuming that XRISM J0918-1212 is a member galaxy of Hydra A cluster, whose distance is z = 0.05 (∼ 300 Mpc). Although the decaying time scale is ∼ t-1, this event might be a possible tidal disruption event. 
 
  
 
We derived the above systematic error for the flux by comparing our derived values for the sources detected with XTS in several observations with those for the corresponding X-ray counterparts. We estimated the systematic error for the source position from the separations between the detected sources with the corresponding counterparts in the same field of view."

Supernova SN2025gvs was first reported on 05/04/2025 on the Transient Name Server,  TNS#251047. Located at  RA=15:50:23.398 Dec=+25:55:10.03, and classified on 06/04/2025 as a type II, with early similarities to type IIb or type IIP.

Using the e-MERLIN radio interferometer, we made observations centred on the reported location, with a total time on target of 04:21:26 (hh:mm:ss), using the C-band receivers at a centre frequency of 6.3 GHz.  We report no radio source within 5 arcseconds of the reported location, with a 3-sigma RMS of 99 microJy/beam, consistent with a non-detection at this time.

At an estimated distance of 31 Mpc, the 3-sigma limit suggests an upper monochromatic luminosity limit of 1.05e26 erg/s/Hz at 6.3 GHz. Further observations of this supernova are planned.

We thank the staff of the e-Merlin for their support and assistance with these observations. e-MERLIN is a National Facility operated by the University of Manchester at Jodrell Bank Observatory on behalf of STFC, part of UK Research and Innovation."

The targets were supplied by GOTO and ATLAS. Targets were identified using the target management platform YSE-PZ (Coulter et al., 2023, PASP, 135, 4501). The classifications were performed with SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024).

Notes: 
When the redshift is given to 2 decimal places, it is derived from the SN spectrum. Otherwise, the redshift is determined from the host galaxy. 
(1) We note that at z = 0.092, the SN has a peak r-band absolute magnitude of ~-19 mag, which is high for the SN Ic luminosity distribution (Drout et al., 2011, ApJ, 741, 97). Although SNID also finds acceptable matches to SNe Ia-91T, the light curve shows a long photometric rise of nearly 2 months. Thus, we rule out (relatively normal) SN Ia classifications. 
(2) SN2025few was previously classified as ""SN"" by Desai (2025, TNSCR 1141)."

FAST has been monitoring FRB 20121102A for 20 minutes monthly since February of 2023, with the central beam of the FAST 19-beam L-band receiver pointing to RA = 05h31m58.70s, DEC = +33d08m52.5s (Chatterjee et al. 2017; Marcote et al. 2017), taking pulsar-search data with a 49.152 microsecond sampling and 4096 frequency channels in between 1.0 GHz and 1.5 GHz.  
Following non-detections since 28 December 2023, FAST detected 61 bursts from FRB 20121102A in 20 minutes during UTC 2025-04-14 07:29:00 - 07:49:00, with the brightest burst at the topocentric coordinate time of MJD 60779.320601234. The burst rate reaches ~180/hr above the fluence threshold of 0.015 Jy ms, indicating that this repeater is likely entering another active episode. 
This recent activation of FRB 20121102A is generally consistent with the proposed periodicity around 160 days (Rajwade et al. 2020; Cruces et al. 2020; Braga et al. 2025; Wang et al. 2025), even though in several previous projected active windows no burst was detected by FAST.  
The dispersion measure (DM) of the bright burst is optimized to 543.5 +/- 0.1 pc cm^-3 using the DM-power package (Lin et al. 2023), decreasing by about 9 pc cm^-3 compared to previous detections in Wang et al. (2025) and ATel#15619, suggesting a consistent temporal DM decrease trend of ~ -4.5 pc cm^-3 yr^-1. 
 
We encourage more follow-up monitoring efforts with multi-band facilities.

We report on recent Swift UVOT observations of SN 2025coe, recently classified as a potential Ca-rich SN Ib (Andrews et al. 2025).  This class of supernovae is notable for particularly rapid increases and decreases to and from peak flux levels, and for spectra that are dominated by Ca at late times.  It is possible that double-white dwarf binaries, or white dwarf plus neutron star binaries, are the progenitors of Ca-rich SN Ib. 
We analyzed a set of 9 UVOT observations, spanning MJD 60732-60751.  In the W2 filter, the measured flux density on MJD 60732 is F_nu = 5.9 +/- 0.2 E-15 erg/cm2/s/A, falling to F_nu = 0.96 +/- 0.05 E-15 two days later on MJD 60734.  The UVOT M2 filter has the smallest red leak, and in this band the flux density falls from F_nu = 4.9 +/- 0.2 E-15 erg/cm2/s/A to F_nu = 0.8 +/- 0.1 E-15 erg/cm2/s/A over the same two days.  Apart from the V band, which shows a relatively steady flux at all times, the other UVOT bands show similarly sharp declines, and all bands appear to reach a quasi-steady flux level by 60742, just 10 days after the initial UVOT exposure. 
Further photometry and spectroscopy are encouraged at all wavelengths.

This FRB is particularly interesting because it is one of the brightest and from a nearby galaxy. The Einstein Probe (EP) team detected a candidate X-ray counterpart (ATel#17100) that was later proven to be likely unrelated to the FRB based on Chandra observations (ATel#17119). 
We recorded and searched all 19 beam data from the FAST 19-beam receiver (1-1.5GHz) and found no signal with S/N>7 between the DM 140-180 pc cm^{-3}, equivalent to a burst fluence limit of about 17.5 mJy ms for a fiducial burst width of 1 ms. Our fluence limit corresponds to an upper limit of 1.7x10^{34} erg for the burst energy, assuming a source distance of 40 Mpc.  Our result confirms the conclusion drawn by the hyperflash team (Atel#17124) that the FRB is unlikely to be an active repeater with a lower burst energy limit."

FRB 20250316A is an exceptionally bright fast radio burst (FRB) discovered and localised by CHIME/FRB and its Outriggers to a nearby host galaxy, NGC 4141, at ~40 Mpc (ATel #17081, #17086, #17114).  
 
We observed FRB 20250316A at high cadence as part of the HyperFlash project, which monitors known (repeating) FRB sources using a network of 25- to 32-meter European radio telescopes. Observations are carried out on a best-effort basis and, whenever possible, the telescopes observe simultaneously at complementary wavelengths. During this campaign, we observed using telescopes at Westerbork (Netherlands), Dwingeloo (Netherlands), Stockert (Germany), Torun (Poland), and Onsala (Sweden). We previously described our observing strategy in ATel #16565 and Kirsten et al. 2024. 
 
Between 16 March (MJD 60750) and 26 March 2025 (MJD 60760), we accumulated a total of 170 hours of exposure across all five telescopes. Accounting for simultaneous observations, this corresponds to 120 hours at L-band (1.4 GHz) and 20 hours at P-band (0.33 GHz). We detected no bursts above our completeness thresholds of 15 Jy ms (L-band) and 70 Jy ms (P-band), which corresponds to an emitted energy of ~1036 erg assuming a burst bandwidth of 100 MHz.  
 
The absence of subsequent bursts, combined with the source's exceptional proximity, suggests that FRB 20250316A is unlikely to be a hyperactive repeater. Instead, it may emit bursts at a much lower repetition rate or lower energies. Alternatively, this source could be  a non-repeating FRB."

We performed an e-MERLIN follow-up of the FRB 20250316A (ATel #17081). Observations were carried out under DDT project RR19005 (PI Bruni) on 2025-03-26, between 03:30 - 12:30 UT, in C-band (4.82-5.33 GHz). The array was pointed to the coordinates of the possible X-ray counterpart identified by the EP collaboration (ATel #17100). Phase referencing was applied. Visibilities were calibrated through the e-Merlin pipeline (Moldon 2021, ascl:2109.006), and imaged in CASA. The image resolution in natural weighting was 57x51 mas. 
   
An RMS of 23 uJy/beam was reached, and no source was detected either within the uncertainty region of the EP coordinates (+/-10 arcsec), or in the more recent CHIME/FRB Outriggers refined position (ATel#17114). This sets a 5-sigma upper limit of 115 uJy for the possible PRS flux density at 5 GHz. At the distance of NGC4141, this translates into a luminosity upper limit of L_nu<1E26 erg/s/Hz, in agreement with the previous one from VLA archival data at 9 GHz from 2012 (ATel #17111). This upper limit is more than two orders of magnitude lower than the luminosity of the PRSs known to date, suggesting that the presence of a PRS associated with FRB 20250316A is unlikely.

We observed the X-ray source EP J120944.2+585060, which was suggested to be possibly associated with FRB 20250316A (ATel #17100, ATel #17086, ATel #17081), with the High Resolution Camera (HRC) on board the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The observation started on 2025 March 27 at 21:31:18 UT with an exposure of 10.65 ks under a DDT proposal (PI: Sun). Within the FXT error circle, an X-ray source is detected (at >8 sigma confidence level) at the position:

RA (J2000) = 12:09:43.72

Dec (J2000) = +58:50:51.4

with an uncertainty of 0.74 arcsec (68% confidence level, stat+sys).

The unabsorbed flux of the source measured in the 0.5-10 keV is 1.3(-0.4, +0.6)e-14 erg/cm2/s (uncertainties at the 90% confidence level), which is consistent with the previous EP-FXT measurements, confirming this source as EP J120944.2+585060. However, the position is offset by 7 arcsec from the precise localization of FRB 20250316A provided by the full CHIME/FRB Outriggers array (ATel #17114). This relatively large spatial separation, considering the sub-arcsec uncertainties of both the FRB and Chandra/HRC positions, suggests that EP J120944.2+585060 is likely not physically associated with FRB 20250316A.

At the position of FRB 20250316A, we derive a 90% flux upper limit of 7.6e-15 erg/cm2/s in the 0.5 - 10 keV band, assuming an absorbed power-law spectrum with a photon index of 2 and NH = 1.4e20 cm^-2.

We thank the CXO team for scheduling these very fast observations, which enabled the precise localization of the X-ray source."

FRB 20250316A is a bright fast radio burst (FRB) discovered by the CHIME/FRB Collaboration (ATel #17081) and associated with the nearby galaxy NGC 4141, located at a distance of ~40 Mpc. Using the full CHIME/FRB Outriggers VLBI array, the FRB source was localized with sub-arcsecond precision (ATels #17086, #17114, #17115) to a region near a clump of extended optical emission (ATel #17116, GCN #39887). Observations with the Einstein Probe (EP) Follow-up X-ray Telescope (FXT) revealed a potentially variable X-ray source (ATel #17100) spatially coincident with FRB 20250316A (ATels #17100, #17114, #17115).

We performed six target-of-opportunity (ToO) X-ray observations of FRB 20250316A using NICER, starting at 2025-03-18 00:44:27 UTC and ending on 2025-03-21 00:26:58 UTC, with a total exposure of 6.7 ks. We report 3σ upper limits on the persistent 0.5-10 keV X-ray flux (Fx) of FRB 20250316A, assuming a fiducial absorbed power-law spectral model with a hydrogen column density of NH = 1.43 × 1020 cm-2 and a photon index of Γ = 2 (see Pearlman et al. 2025 for details).

Observation Mid-Time (UTC) | 3σ Persistent X-ray Flux Upper Limit (erg cm-2 s-1):  
2025-03-18 00:53:49 | Fx< 4 × 10-13 
2025-03-18 08:33:33 | Fx< 1 × 10-12 
2025-03-19 00:12:49 | Fx< 5 × 10-13

2025-03-21 00:13:11 | Fx< 7 × 10-14 
 
 
These NICER X-ray flux upper limits are consistent with previous X-ray flux measurements of EP J120944.2+585060 obtained from EP/FXT and Swift/XRT observations (ATels #17100, #17101, #17109). Our deepest NICER X-ray flux upper limit corresponds to a 3σ upper limit of Lx< 1040 erg s-1 on the persistent X-ray luminosity of FRB 20250316A in the 0.5-10 keV energy range, using a distance of 40 Mpc to FRB 20250316A (ATel #17081).

We also carried out a search for X-ray bursts in the NICER data, with widths between 100 ns and 100 s, using a Bayesian Blocks algorithm (Scargle 1998; Pearlman et al. 2025). No astrophysical X-ray bursts were detected with a statistical significance above 3σ.

Additionally, we performed a search for X-ray pulsations between 0.1 and 1000 Hz in the NICER data using the Rayleigh (Z12) statistic (Buccheri et al. 1983). We also conducted a PRESTO-based acceleration search with zmax = ± 200 Fourier bins (Ransom et al. 2002). These periodicity searches were conducted in the 0.5-2.0, 2.0-10.0, and 0.5-10.0 keV energy ranges using all of our NICER observations, as well as data from individual exposures. In each case, no significant evidence of X-ray pulsations was found above a 3σ detection threshold.

NICER observations on 2025-03-18 and 2025-03-20 were scheduled during high time resolution follow-up radio observations of FRB 20250316A with CHIME/Pulsar (The CHIME/Pulsar Collaboration et al. 2021). We performed a coherent search for radio bursts with widths between 40.96 μs and 13 ms (see Pearlman et al. 2025 for details). No radio bursts were detected above a signal-to-noise ratio of 7 in the 400-800 MHz band during these CHIME/Pulsar observations.

These NICER observations were performed under an approved NICER General Observer Cycle 7 ToO program focused on X-ray observations of nearby FRB sources (PI: A. B. Pearlman). NICER will continue to observe FRB 20250316A.

The CHIME/FRB Collaboration reports on optical imaging and spectroscopy of the sub-arcsecond CHIME Outrigger localization (ATel #17114) of the nearby, bright FRB 20250316A (ATel #17081). We obtained deep g-band observations starting at 24 March 2025 12:39:44 UT (PI: T. Eftekhari; 15 x 120-sec exposures) with the Gemini-North Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS-N) mounted on the 8-m Gemini North telescope at Maunakea, Hawai'i. Observations were taken in clear conditions with an average airmass of 1.6 and seeing of 0.8â. We do not detect any strong, possible transient (point source) optical emission at the FRB location (1-sigma #17114) and measure a 3-sigma point-source limiting magnitude at this location of g > 23.8 mag (AB). However, we detect a clump of extended optical emission in the host galaxy, offset from the FRB localization region by ~1.2ââ (measured from the brightest pixel in the g-band image). At a distance to NGC 4141 of ~40 Mpc, the corresponding projected physical distance between the FRB and this clump is ~250 pc. 
We also obtained long-slit optical spectroscopy with GMOS-N starting at 25 March 2025 10:41:44 (PI: T. Eftekhari; 8 x 900-sec exposures) at an airmass of ~1.33. We used a 1â slit width, the B480 grating, and the GG455 blocking filter at central wavelengths of 640 and 650 nm. The slit was oriented at a position angle of 10.6 degrees East of North to cover both the FRB localization region and the nearby extended optical emission. While we do not detect any transient spectral features or features at the FRB position, we detect strong nebular emission from the nearby optical clump, including H-beta, H-alpha, and [OIII] at a common redshift of z~0.0065, consistent with emission from a star-forming region within the host. 
We thank Gemini Observatory staff, including Jennifer Andrews, for assistance with planning and executing the observations."

We have derived a sub-arcsecond VLBI localization for FRB 20250316A (see ATel #17081, ATel #17086; this is the first such localization using the full CHIME/FRB Outriggers array. This consists of the CHIME core and the KKO Outrigger (Lanman et al. 2024) near Penticton, BC, and two additional Outrigger stations at Green Bank Observatory (GBO) and Hat Creek Radio Observatory (HCO). The position below is consistent with the ~10"" position of the potential X-ray counterpart EP J120944.2+585060 detected by the Einstein Probe (ATel #17100) but is inconsistent with the 90% confidence interval reported from Swift/XRT observations (ATel #17109).

We derive our position by referencing delays on each of the three CHIME-Outrigger baselines to nearby in-beam International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF) calibrators observed simultaneously with the FRB  (Andrew et al. 2024). On all CHIME-Outrigger baselines, we phase reference our visibilities to the calibrator RFC J1204+5202 (https://astrogeo.org/sol/rfc/rfc_2024b/; Petrov & Kovalev 2025), located ~6 degrees away from the FRB.

Five additional in-beam ICRF calibrators were observed on all three baselines between CHIME and its Outriggers, which we use to derive a representative error budget for the FRB localization. The calibrators completely surround the FRB, spanning ~+/- 1 degree in hour angle and +50/-20 degrees in declination relative to CHIME zenith, while the FRB is located ~0.2 degrees east and ~10 degrees north of CHIME zenith. We check for imperfect calibrator selection and direction-dependent effects by 1) calibrating the target to all other usable calibrators, and 2) calibrating known calibrator positions to other calibrators, which maximizes on-sky angular separations. Both procedures give RMS delay errors no larger than 1 ns, 3 ns, and 6ns on the CHIME-KKO, CHIME-HCO and CHIME-GBO baselines, respectively. This yields the following 1-sigma (stat+sys) localization ellipse for the location of FRB 20250316A:

Right Ascension = 12h09m44.31s

Declination = +58d50m56.70s

a_err = 150 milliarcsec

b_err = 100 milliarcsec

theta = 2.4 degrees East of North

All coordinates are in the ICRF. We have included our one-sigma localization contour over the Epoch 1 r-band MMT image reported in ATel #17112. We note that to account for astrometric offsets due to optical-radio reference frame ties, we have inflated our localization errors in the plot by 150mas (added in quadrature).

The full four-station array is still being commissioned, and its astrometric performance will be fully characterized in an upcoming work. However, we note that the error from our bootstrapping procedure is consistent with our archival test localizations of over 200 ICRF calibrators and well-localized pulsars at similar target-calibrator separations and at cross-correlation signal-to-noise ratios lower than those in the dataset used here. Furthermore, the abundance of in-beam calibrators may enable additional improvements on the preliminary position quoted here. Follow-up observations are strongly encouraged to definitively establish whether EP J120944.2+585060 is spatially coincident with FRB 20250316A, and to characterize the nature of this potential X-ray counterpart."

The CHIME/FRB Collaboration reports on optical imaging of the CHIME-KKO localization (ATel #17086) of the nearby, bright FRB 20250316A and its most probable host galaxy NGC 4141 (ATel #17081). We obtained deep r-band observations starting at 23 March 2025 05:39:03 UT (PI: J. Rastinejad; 35 x 90-sec exposures) with the Binospec optical spectrograph mounted on the 6.5-m MMT telescope atop Mt. Hopkins, Arizona. Observations were taken in clear conditions with an average airmass of 1.2 and seeing of 1.0''. We measure a 3-sigma point-source limiting magnitude on the image of r > 25.8 mag (AB).

We obtained a second set of r-band observations starting at 24 March 2025 13:58:07 UT (PI: Y. Dong; 39 x 90-sec exposures) in 1.1'' seeing at an airmass of 1.7 to assess variability between the two epochs. The observations were taken ~32 hr after the first epoch and at comparable depth. We performed image subtraction between the two epochs and do not detect any significant residuals within the reported CHIME-KKO localization (ATel #17086) nor the Einstein Probe candidate X-ray source position (ATel #17100). The non-detection of any optical emission is consistent with previous reports by Troja et al, (GCN 39869), Jiang et al., (GCN 39864), Pereyra et al., (GCN 39858), Aryan et et al., (GCN 39839), Hashimoto et al., (Atel #17095), and Becerra et al., (ATel #17082), although our limits occur on a longer timescale and are significantly deeper.

Following image subtraction, we place a 3-sigma limit of r ~ 25 mag (AB) on the presence of transient optical emission ~8.23 days after the reported FRB. We emphasize that our observations are only sensitive to sources that vary between the two epochs, and are not sensitive to longer-timescale variability. However, visual inspection relative to optical imaging in DECaLS demonstrates no new sources in our data brighter than the nominal limit of the survey (r > 23.5 mag). At the distance of NGC 4141 (d~40 Mpc), the upper limit of r ~25 mag (AB) or M_r ~ -8 mag (accounting for Milky Way extinction) corresponds to an in-band luminosity of 3.3E38 erg/s.  With this limit, we are sensitive to the presence of fast-evolving transients such as gamma-ray burst afterglows, fast blue optical transients, and even bright classical novae.

We thank MMT Observatory staff Skyler Self and Benjamin Weiner for scheduling and executing the observations, and Alexa C. Gordon and Jillian Rastinejad (Northwestern) for their assistance in rapid data reduction and analysis."

We analyzed archival NRAO Very Large Array (VLA) observations of the field of FRB 20250316A (VOEvent #439373176, ATel #17081) to search for an associated persistent radio source (PRS). The VLA observed the field most recently on 2012 November 30 from 18:00-18:30 UTC under program VLA/12A-059 to target SN 2008X in NGC 4141. The total on-source time was 13m21s, the array was in A-configuration, and observed the field with the lower subband of the EVLA X-band (8-10 GHz) for an approximate synthesized beam size of 0.2 arcseconds. We calibrated the data using NRAO CASA (v6.6.1) with the most recent VLA Pipeline (v2024.1.0.8) and imaged the field using standard wideband parameters. The image phase center was set to the originally-reported coordinates of 12h09m54.24s +58d50m57.84s (J2000) from CHIME (ATel #17081) which revealed a single source in the field consistent with the reported errors of the original position. The source is located at 12h09m56.18s +58d51m05.00s (J2000) and has a flux density of 30 +/- 5 micro-Jy, and is coincident with the nucleus of the galaxy WISEA J120956.19+585105.1 (z=0.245+/-0.03 from the  Legacy Survey DR9 Photo-z Survey). We estimate a luminosity nu L_nu = 3E38 erg/s, typical for radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (AGN) and attribute the radio source to a low-level AGN in this background galaxy.

The updated CHIME-KKO position (ATel #17086) is approximately 2 arcminutes westward from the original position and no PRS is detected with a 3-sigma upper limit of 15 micro-Jy. At the distance of 40 Mpc for NGC 4141 the luminosity upper limit on a PRS is L_nu = 3E25 erg/s/Hz. This limit is ~1E3.5 lower than previously-detected PRSs associated with some repeating FRBs, and the best limit to date other than FRB 20200120E in M81.

We note that this limit also applies at the position of the weak and apparently steady X-ray source identified in Einstein Probe Wide-field X-ray Telescope (ATel #17083), Einstein Probe Follow-up X-ray Telescope (ATel #17100), and Swift/XRT observations (ATel #17101, ATel #17109).

We reobserved the field of FRB 20250316A (ATel #17081) with Swift starting on 2025-03-23 (~7 days after the FRB) for a total exposure of 10 ks.  
  
A blind search does not identify any X-ray source consistent with the CHIME localization (ATel #17086). However, a targeted search at the position of EP J120944.2+585060 (Sun et al., ATel #17100) finds a weak X-ray source at RA, Dec (J2000) = 182.4369,  58.8471 deg with a 90% error radius of 6 arcsec (stat+sys), as derived by xrtcentroid. The detection is significant at the >99.7% confidence level (Kraft, Nousek, and Burrows, 1991). A finder chart can be found at:

Based on a preliminary analysis, we infer a count rate of (7 +/- 3)E-4 cts/s which corresponds to an observed flux of (2.4 +/- 1.0)E-14 erg/cm2/s (0.3-10 keV) assuming an absorbed power-law spectrum with a photon index of 2 and NH = 1.4E+20 cm^-2. Our observations are consistent with the reported flux for EP J120944.2+585060 (Sun et al., ATel #17100) and do not show substantial variability.  
 
We performed an independent analysis of the first epoch of Swift observations, taken at 12 hrs after the burst (Yang et al., ATel #17101). Using the above XRT position, we derive a 90% upper limit of 7E-4 cts/s,  consistent with our reported value.  
  
Within the XRT localization, no optical counterpart is visible in the Swift UVOT White image down to >22.3 AB mag

The observation was conducted on 2025-03-16 at 21:10:00 UTC, 12.6 hours after the first detection (Ng et al., ATel #17081), with a total exposure time of approximately 5 ks. 
 
No significant X-ray source was detected by XRT within the refined CHIME-KKO localization region (Leung et al., ATel #17086). Using the method described by Kraft et al. (1991), we estimated a 90% confidence level (CL) upper limit for the count rate at 0.00046073 c/s. Assuming a photon index of 2 and NH = 1.43E+20 cm^-2 along the line of sight to the position (at z=0.0067; Connor, ATel #17091), WebPIMMS predicts an unabsorbed flux of 1.300E-14 ergs cm^-2 s^-1 in the 0.5 - 10 keV band, which is consistent with the flux level of EP J120944.2+585060 (Sun et al., ATel #17100). 
 
No uncataloged optical counterpart consistent with the CHIME-KKO location was detected in the UVOT observation, with a total exposure of 154.29 seconds using the WHITE filter. A 3-sigma upper limit magnitude of >22.13 (AB system) was obtained.

We observed the field of the bright fast radio burst FRB 20250316A (Ng, ATel #17081) with the Follow-up X-ray Telescope (FXT) on board the Einstein Probe (EP) mission. A total of four observations were conducted. In the first observation, which began at 2025-03-17T16:57:29(UTC) with an exposure time of 2.9 ks, no X-ray sources were detected within 3 arcmin of the CHIME position. In the second observation, starting at 2025-03-18T15:23:50(UTC) with also 2.9 ks exposure, FXT detected a weak, uncatalogued X-ray source, designated as EP J120944.2+585060. The position of this source is consistent with the refined localization provided by CHIME (Leung, ATel #17086). The unabsorbed X-ray flux is 3.4 x 10^-14 erg/cm2/s in the 0.5 - 10 keV band.

In the third observation starting at 2025-03-21T05:50:01(UTC) with an exposure of 5.8 ks, the X-ray source was clearly detected at a flux consistent with the previous level. The refined source position is RA = 182.4341 deg, Dec = 58.8499 deg (J2000) with an uncertainty of 10 arcsec in radius (90% C.L. statistical and systematic). This position remains consistent with the CHIME localization, suggestive of EP J120944.2+585060 being likely associated with the source of FRB 20250316A. Preliminary analysis of the forth observation, taken 11 hours after the third one, shows a marginal trend of decrease of the source flux, though the the telemetry data received is not complete yet. Further analysis is ongoing. A Chandra DDT observation has been requested.

If EP J120944.2+585060 is indeed associated with FRB 20250316A and located near the candidate host galaxy NGC 4141, which has a redshift of 0.0067 (Connor, ATel #17091), the inferred X-ray luminosity is approximately 3 x 10^39 erg/s in the 0.5 - 10 keV band during the EP observations.

Launched on January 9, 2024, EP is a space X-ray observatory to monitor the soft X-ray sky with X-ray follow-up capability (Yuan et al. 2022, Handbook of X-ray and Gamma-ray Astrophysics). EP is a mission of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in collaboration with ESA, MPE and CNES."

The first LOT epoch of observations in the r band started at 16:08 UT on the 20th of March 2025 (MJD = 60754.6725), ~4.3158 days after the CHIME detection, while the first SLT epoch of observations in the g band started at 16:23 UT on the 20th of March 2025 (MJD = 660754.6827), ~4.3258 days after the CHIME detection. 
  
We utilized the astroalign (Beroiz et al., 2020, A&C, 32, 100384) and astropy (Astropy Collaboration et al., 2022, ApJ, 935, 167) packages to align and stack the individual frames. In the stacked frame, we do not detect any potential uncataloged optical afterglow counterpart candidate within the updated localization provided by Leung et al. (ATel#17086). Moreover, we employed the Python-based package AutoPhOT (Brennan & Fraser, 2022, A&A, 667, A62) to perform template subtraction utilizing the ""sfft"" (Hu, 2022, ApJ, 936, 157) and ""hotpants"" (Becker A., 2015, ascl.soft. ascl:1504.004) algorithms, using templates from Pan-STARRS1 (Chambers et al. 2016 arXiv:1612.05560). We found no evidence of any prominent optical afterglow counterpart candidate in the difference images as well. 
  
We further employed AutoPhOT to perform PSF photometry on the combined frames. The details of the observation and 3-sigma upper limits (in the AB system) were as follows:

The non-detection of any optical afterglow counterpart candidate is consistent with previous reports by Becerra et al., (ATel#17082) and Niino et al., (ATel#17083).

Konus-Wind (KW, Aptekar et al., 1995) was observing the whole sky at the time of the

hereafter T0; Mason Ng et al., ATel #17081; Calvin Leung et al., ATel #17086).

No triggered or waiting-mode KW events happened during ~19 hours 
before T0. The first event detected after T0 is GRB 250316A, ~26 minutes after T0, 
which localization is inconsistent with FRB 20250316A (Ronchini et al., GCN 39744). 
Using waiting-mode data within the interval T0 +/- 200 s, 
we found no significant (> 5 sigma) excess over the background

We estimate upper limits (90% conf.) on the 20 - 1500 keV fluence

with alpha =-0.5 and Ep=500 keV) and to 1.7x10^-7 erg/cm^2 for a burst 
having spectrum similar to that of SGR/FRB 200428 (a CPL with alpha =-0.72 
and Ep=85 keV). For a typical long GRB spectrum (the Band function with 
alpha=-1, beta=-2.5, and Ep=300 keV), the corresponding limiting peak flux  
is 1.3x10^-7 erg/cm^2/s (20 - 1500 keV, 2.944 s scale).

Assuming the distance of ~40 Mpc to the probable host galaxy NGC 4141 (ATel #17081; ATel #17086) 
we estimate the following upper limits on the event hard-energy emission (20-1500 keV): the isotropic-equivalent energy release Eiso (~8.7x10^46 erg) and the peak luminosity Liso  (~3.0x10^46 erg/s) , both in the range of bright extragalactic magnetar giant flares (Svinkin et al. 2021, Nature 589, 211).

We have successfully used early commissioning data from the full CHIME/FRB Outriggers array to obtain a sub-arcsecond VLBI position for fast radio burst (FRB) 20250316A (ATel #17081). Early tests reveal that the astrometric accuracy of the Outriggers array is on the order of 0.05'' x 0.1'', but uncertainty quantification is not yet available for the Green Bank and Hat Creek Outrigger stations.

We report below a refined localization relative to ATel #17081: we have re-run the baseband localization with temperature corrections, and inflated the resulting uncertainties to 80'' in each dimension. Using the baseband localization as a prior, we have refined the position using the 66-km baseline between CHIME and the KKO station, which constrains the position more precisely along one axis using a previously-validated localization procedure (Lanman et al. (2025), CHIME/FRB Collaboration et al. (2025)). The below CHIME-KKO position is insensitive to the systematic errors present in the baseband pipeline; it lies within 2 sigmas of the temperature-corrected baseband position (2' offset in EW) and places the FRB in the western half of NGC 4141. In agreement with ATel #17081, the FRB remains robustly associated with NGC 4141. However, both SN 2008X (Boles 2008; Madison et al. 2008) and SN 2009E (Boles 2009; Pastorello et al. 2011) fall well outside of the CHIME-KKO localization contour, ruling out a direct association between FRB 20250316A and either SN. The ellipse coordinates are as follows:

The total exposure time is 9 min (4 min starting 2025-03-17 10:19 + 5 min starting 2025-03-17 16:07, UTC).

Image subtraction is performed using the images of the same field taken more than 2 yrs before the FRB event by the same camera as templates. No transient object was found in the subtraction image within ~ 10 arcmin from the best estimate localization of the FRB.

The CHIME/FRB Collaboration reports a bright (S/N > 5000) fast radio burst (FRB) in the direction of the nearby galaxy NGC 4141. FRB 20250316A (VOEvent #439373176) was detected on 2025 March 16 at 08:33:50.842 (± 0.008) UTC (real-time pipeline; topocentric at 400 MHz) with a nominal real-time pipeline dispersion measure (DM) of 161.3 ± 0.4 pc/cc. Using the raw-voltage data (baseband data), we determine the best-fit localization (Michilli et al. 2021) to be (J2000) R.A. = 182.476 deg., DEC. = +58.8494 deg., (Gal_l = 132.9154 deg., Gal_b = +57.4666 deg.) and the structure-maximizing DM to be 161.81 ± 0.03 pc/cc. Unfortunately, an uncertainty on this position using the raw-voltage data is not currently possible, due to missing system temperature information. We caution that without system temperature information, we are unable to correct for the thermal expansion of the metal structure of the telescope, and thus there may be localization errors of up to a few arcminutes in the N-S direction (Michilli et al. 2021).

Using the baseband position and a representative ~1 arcminute radius error circle, the source appears to be associated with the galaxy NGC 4141 with a PATH probability (Aggarwal et al. 2021) of 94.8%. NGC 4141 is an SBc galaxy at a Tully-Fisher distance of 37-44 Mpc (Sorce et al. 2014; Tully et al. 2016) and with a star formation rate of ~0.6 M⊙/year (Kewley et al. 2005). Two relatively recent core-collapse supernovae have been detected in NGC 4141: SN 2008X (Boles 2008; Madison et al. 2008) and SN 2009E (Boles 2009; Pastorello et al. 2011).

The peak flux density of FRB 20250316A as determined using the baseband data is 1.6 ± 0.1 kJy with a fluence of 1.7 ± 0.2 kJy ms. At a distance of 40 Mpc and assuming isotropy with a bandwidth of 400 MHz, this corresponds to a luminosity of ~1042 erg/s and an emitted energy of ~1039 erg, given a burst width of 0.7 ms (see method of Fonseca et al. 2023).

A ToO request was sent to Swift, which is on target as of 21:07 UTC on 2025 March 16. We have requested follow-up observations with the Onsala 25-m telescope, as well as with NICER. We encourage additional multiwavelength follow-up.

At the distance of NGC 4141, the estimated foreground DM due to the intergalactic medium is ~5 pc/cc. The expected foreground DM contribution from the Milky Way disk in this direction is ~20-30 pc/cc (Cordes & Lazio 2002; Yao et al. 2016). For an assumed upper limit on the Milky Way halo contribution of <50 pc/cc (Cook et al. 2023), the DM contribution of the host galaxy and FRB local environment is then ~75-135 pc/cc.

Sub-arcsecond VLBI localization of the source using the CHIME/Outriggers is currently in progress and will be reported in a follow-up ATel as soon as possible.

On 2025-03-09 at 07:36:04.75 UT IceCube detected a track-like event with a high probability of being of astrophysical origin. The event was selected by the ICECUBE_Astrotrack_GOLD alert stream. This alert has an estimated false alarm rate of 0.18 events per year due to atmospheric backgrounds. The IceCube detector was in a normal operating state at the time of detection. 
 
After the initial automated alert (https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/notices_amon_g_b/140626_1288692.amon), more sophisticated reconstruction algorithms have been applied offline, with the direction refined to:

RA: 211.07 (+0.31 -0.30 deg  90% PSF containment) J2000 
 
Dec: -10.73 (+0.26 -0.30 deg 90% PSF containment) J2000 
 
The inferred neutrino energy of this alert is ~4 PeV, making it the fourth-highest energy known detection by IceCube over the past decade. 
 
The alert is in spatial coincidence with the Fermi GRB250309B (Fermi-GBM trigger 763198715 at 07:38:30.66 on 09 March 2025; https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/other/763198715.fermi) with a time 145.91 seconds before the GBM trigger. The angular distance to the most updated reconstruction released by the GBM team, which has a 1 sigma statistical error of 1.60 deg, is 0.77 degrees. An alternative algorithm results in a shifted direction (https://gcn.nasa.gov/circulars/39629) with an angular distance from the best fit neutrino direction of 3.18 degrees and has a 1 sigma statistical error of 1.3 degree and a systematic error of 1 degree. 
 
We strongly encourage follow-up observations of the neutrino region of interest and the uncertainty region of GRB250309B. 
 
No known gamma-ray sources listed in the Fermi 4FGL-DR4 or 3FHL catalogs are located within the 90% uncertainty region of the event.

We report the classifications of astrophysical transients from spectroscopic observations with the Kast spectrograph on the Shane telescope obtained on 2025 February 27 UT. The targets were supplied by YSE, ZTF, and SGLF (from the ZTF data stream). Targets were identified using the target management platform YSE-PZ (Coulter et al., 2023, PASP, 135, 4501). The classifications were performed with SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024).

Notes: 
When the redshift is given to 2 decimal places, it is derived from the SN spectrum. Otherwise, the redshift is determined from the host galaxy. 
(1) We measure a Si II 6355 velocity of -9,800 km/s. 
(2) We measure a host redshift from our spectrum consistent with that reported in NED. However, we find that the SN has matches only to young SNe Ia at z < 0.01. Using the reported host redshift, we measure a Si II 6355 velocity of -25,000 km/s."

The MAXI/GSC detected a relatively soft X-ray transient source at 11:00 UT on February 9, 2025. Assuming that the source flux was constant over the transit, we obtain the source position at 
(R.A., Dec) = (222.844 deg, 30.986 deg) = (14 51 22, +30 59 09) (J2000) 
with a statistical 90% C.L. elliptical error region with long and short radii of 0.35 deg and 0.32 deg, respectively. The roll angle of the long axis from the north direction is 54.0 deg counterclockwise. There is an additional systematic uncertainty of 0.1 deg (90% containment radius). The X-ray flux averaged over the scan was 133 +- 34 mCrab (4.0-10.0keV, 1 sigma error). 
Without assumptions on the source constancy, we obtain a rectangular error box for the transient source with the following corners: 
(R.A., Dec) = (221.544, 29.670) deg = (14 46 10, +29 40 12) (J2000) 
(R.A., Dec) = (222.164, 29.349) deg = (14 48 39, +29 20 56) (J2000) 
(R.A., Dec) = (223.910, 31.810) deg = (14 55 38, +31 48 35) (J2000) 
(R.A., Dec) = (223.280, 32.140) deg = (14 53 07, +32 08 24) (J2000) 
There was no significant excess flux in the previous transit at 09:27 UT and in the next transit at 12:33 UT with an upper limit of 20 mCrab for each. 
 
This transient event is positionally consistent with a nearby M4.0Ve star G 166-49 (a.k.a. 1RXS J145110.3+310648) and GRB 190306A (GCN Circ. #23937, #23941). This and the relatively soft X-ray spectrum suggest that this event originates from an X-ray flare from G 166-49. If so, the luminosity of the flare is about 6.0e31 erg/cm2/s for 13 pc distance, and that GRB 190306A might be an X-ray flare from this source though GRB 190306A showed a harder spectrum. We also designates this event GRB 250209A because of the un-identification. 
 
We crosspost this to the ATel and the GCN Circular for both communities.

The CHIME/FRB Collaboration reports the spatial and temporal proximity of the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK) compact-object merger candidate S250206dm (GCN 39175; likely either BH-NS or NS-NS) and the fast radio burst (FRB) 20250206A.  
    FRB 20250206A was detected by CHIME/FRB at 2025 Feb 06, 21:26:27.956253 p/m 0.000008 UTC (topocentric at 400 MHz) about 52 seconds (having corrected for dispersive delay) after the LVK event's topocentric time.  
    From recorded voltage data, we obtain a best-fit localization (Michilli et al. 2021) of RA, Decl. (J2000) 338.703, 12.1699 degrees, with 1-sigma uncertainties of 0.42, 0.28 arcminutes, respectively.  
    Using LVK code for estimating the localization region of a given position (https://bit.ly/3CJsyu6) and the most updated Bilby skymap, the FRB position is at the 99.96% credible region of the Bilby localization, i.e., the FRB position is unlikely to be spatially coincident with the LVK localization.

Using our raw voltage data, the burst's structure-maximized dispersion measure (DM) is 207.117 +/- 0.003 pc cm^-3.  
    With a Galactic disk DM estimate of 40 pc cm^-3 from NE2001 and assuming a Galactic halo DM of 38 pc cm^-3, (Yamasaki & Totani 2020), the residual extragalactic DM is ~130 pc cm^-3.  
    Using a redshift-DM relationship for the intergalactic medium of z ~ DM / 800 pc cm^-3 (Connor et al. 2024), this extragalactic DM corresponds to an upper limit on the luminosity distance (i.e., assuming no DM contribution from a host galaxy) of ~800 Mpc (assuming LambdaCDM parameters from Planck Collaboration 2018), consistent with the LVK-inferred luminosity distance of 348 +/- 114 Mpc (GCN 39184).  
    The FRB was detected with a signal-to-noise ratio of 16.4 in one CHIME/FRB beam, and 15.7 in a second beam.  
    A preliminary baseband fluence averaged over the entire 400-800 MHz CHIME observing band is 36 +/- 4 Jy ms (1-sigma uncertainty).  
    The source does not appear to be a repeat burst from any previously detected CHIME FRB abovea signal-to-noise ratio of 8.

The source has clear scattering, with a characteristic timescale of ~0.05-0.10 ms at 600 MHz (Fonseca et al. 2023).  
    The Galactic scattering contribution in this direction using NE2001p at 600 MHz is expected to be ~1.5Âµs.  
    The burst is consistent with being 100% linearly polarized and has a Faraday rotation measure (RM) of -62.07 +/- 0.05 rad m^-2, which was determined using RM-synthesis.  
    The Galactic RM towards the FRB is estimated to be -37 +/- 11 rad m^-2 (Hutschenreuter et al. 2020).

The probability of chance coincidence (i.e., the likelihood that the LVK and CHIME/FRB events are temporally and spatially proximal by chance only) is difficult to estimate immediately given the large LVK uncertainty regions and CHIME/FRB's uneven exposure and sensitivity on the sky.  
    With the strong caveat that we do not yet know the joint probability of coincidence (analysis ongoing), and that it is likely non-negligible, we are providing the above information because any potential electromagnetic counterpart will be transient.  
    Due to on-site networking issues, this event was not sent out to the community as a VOEvent.

The MeerTRAP team reports the discovery of a new repeating FRB source, FRB 20240711A. The FRB was first discovered as a single burst on 2024 July 11 at 21:51:39.138 UTC in the UHF band (544-1088 MHz). The burst showed multiple components drifting downwards in frequency (sad trombone effect, see Fig. 1), an effect typically observed in repeating FRBs (Pleunis et al. 2021). By optimising the burst structure (Seymour et al. 2019), we obtained a dispersion measure (DM) of 834.75 pc/cm^3. The region of sky where the first burst was detected is regularly monitored by the MeerKAT telescope, but no detections were made previous to that date. On 2025 January 18, the field in which the FRB was discovered  was re-observed in the UHF band with MeerKAT, and a second burst was detected with a position and DM consistent (to within 6 arcsec and 2 pc/cm^3 respectively)  with the first burst, thus confirming the repeating nature of the source (see Fig. 2). 
The detection of both bursts triggered the storage of channelised voltage data from all MeerKAT antennas. We used the first, brighter burst to localise the source with arcsecond precision using the MeerTRAP transient buffer pipeline (Rajwade et al. 2020). The best coordinates we find are RA=19h02m08.60s DEC=-51d30m30.47s, with a 1-sigma error of 0.7 arcsec in both RA and DEC. We find two optical sources in the DESI Legacy Survey DR10 archival images (see Fig. 3) (Dey et al. 2019) at 3.4 arcsec (S1) and 4.2 arcsec (S2) respectively from the FRB location. Deep optical observations have been planned to identify any potential galaxy closer to the FRB error region. 
The times of arrival of the MeerKAT bursts at the top of the UHF band (1088 MHz) are as below: 
M1: 2024-07-11T21:51:39.138 
M2: 2025-01-18T13:07:14.838 
FRB 20240711A was followed up for repeat bursts using the ultra-wide band (UWL) receiver on the 64-m Murriyang radio telescope, covering 704-4032 MHz. Observations were conducted on January 25 and 30, 2025, for a total of two hours using available green slots. A search for bursts in Murriyang data revealed three bursts on January 25 and two on January 30, each with an S/N above 7, corresponding to a fluence completeness threshold of 0.232 Jy ms. The times of arrival of the detected bursts at 704 MHz are listed below. 
P1: 2025-01-25T05:16:50.447 
P2: 2025-01-25T05:34:41.774 
P3: 2025-01-25T05:45:49.168 
P4: 2025-01-30T05:12:32.305 
P5: 2025-01-30T05:41:30.080 
The dynamic spectra of the two bursts, P3 and P4, are illustrated in Figures 4 and 5, respectively. A preliminary analysis of the polarisation properties of the bursts shows that the Faraday rotation measure (RM) of all bursts remains close to zero within uncertainties. All the bursts exhibit a high linear polarisation fraction of ~80%-90%. Given the low RM and the significant degree of linear polarisation, RM scattering is unlikely to be the dominant cause of the low observed RM. Instead, the low RM may be intrinsic to the source or result from balanced positive and negative RM contributions along the propagation path. As FRB 20240711A is likely still moderately active, we strongly recommend continued observations. 
The MeerKAT telescope is operated by SARAO, a facility of the National Research Foundation, an agency of the Department of Science and Innovation. Murriyang is operated by CSIROâs Australia Telescope National Facility, which is funded by the Australian Government for use by the international scientific community. We extend our gratitude to the team at Murriyang for their support in conducting these follow-up observations.

On 15th April 2021, ATLAS21mwi, a potential supernova transient was reported by the ATLAS bot (Tonry et al., 2021) and given the TNS designation AT2021jve (https://www.wis-tns.org/object/2021jve). The transient was identified as a potential supernova in the ZTF data by the ALeRCE Broker System  (Carrasco-Davis et al., 2021) on 12th May 2021. Using observations taken as part of the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS; McConnell et al. 2021), we found radio emission arising from this transient approximately six months after initial discovery, with non-detections at lower ASKAP frequencies of 0.888 GHz, before it brightened at 1.65 GHz.

We initiated radio observations using the Australian Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) to understand whether the radio emission is consistent with a supernova or its host galaxies AGN. The radio observation with the ATCA took place on 28 October 2024 at frequencies 2.1, 5.5 and 9.0 GHz, and the source was detected at all three observed frequencies. The ATCA observations give a spectral index of -0.93 +/- 0.05, consistent with synchrotron emission arising from a potential supernova forward shock interacting with the circum-stellar material.

We report the detections and 5-sigma upper limits below:

We report on the detection of 8 high-fluence bursts within 7 days originating from FRB 20240114A. FRB 20240114A was initially discovered and reported on by the CHIME/FRB Collaboration (ATel #16420) and has subsequently been detected and localized by a variety of other telescopes (see e.g. ATels #16433, #16434, #16542, #16446, #16597, #16599, #16620 and references therein).  
 
We have been observing FRB 20240114A regularly since its discovery. Our observations between June 2024 and December 2024 add up to 600 hours and led to the detection of 7 bursts at L-band 1.4 GHz (L-band, 500h) and no detections at 330 MHz (P-band, 100h). This indicates that the source continued to be active, but at a lower activity level during this time.  
 
Most recently, we detected single bursts on December 30th and 31st, 2024, while detecting no bursts on January 2, 2025. On January 4, 2025 we detected 6 bursts in only 4.5 hours of observing, indicating high activity at that time. All reported bursts are detected at 1.4 GHz (L-band) and have a fluence higher than our completeness threshold of 10 Jy ms. The brightest event has a fluence of 770 +/- 150 Jy ms. We estimate the fluence by averaging over the full observing bandwidth and applying the radiometer equation using a system equivalent flux density (SEFD) of 250 Jy for Torun. The attached figure shows the dynamic spectra of three events.  
 
In the HyperFlash project, we carry out high-cadence observations of known (repeating) FRB sources using a set of 25 to 32-meter European radio telescopes. Our observing strategy and participating stations have previously been described in ATel #16565 and Kirsten et al. 2024. Observations are carried out on a best-effort basis and, whenever possible, the telescopes observe simultaneously at complementary wavelengths.  
 
Additionally, FRB 20240114A has also been detected by CHIME/FRB on January 1, 2025, as reported on the CHIME/FRB FRB repeater webpage. The detection of our high-fluence bursts within limited observing hours over the past week suggests that the source has entered a state of increased activity. We will continue to monitor FRB 20240114A using HyperFlash and encourage follow up observations at all wavelengths.

The X-ray Telescope did not detect any source at the transient position providing a 0.3-10 keV 3sigma upper limit of <1.56E-02 c/s. 
Assuming a power-law spectrum with photon index 2, this translates to a 0.3-10 keV unabsorbed flux of <7x10^-13 erg/cm2/s. At the source distance, this equates to a limit on the X-ray luminosity L<4x10^40 erg/s.  
 
The source magnitudes (in the AB system) during the first snapshot, starting at the above-mentioned time, were:

We report the classifications of astrophysical transients from spectroscopic observations with the Kast spectrograph on the Shane telescope obtained on 2024 November 04 UT. The targets were supplied by YSE and ZTF, and identified using the target management platform YSE-PZ (Coulter et al., 2023, PASP, 135, 4501). The classifications were performed with SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024).

Notes: 
When the redshift is given to 2 decimal places, it is derived from the SN spectrum. Otherwise, the redshift is determined from the host galaxy. 
(1) The spectrum has a relatively low signal-to-noise ratio, but is reasonably well matched by SNe Ia with a phase of 20-30 days after peak. 
(2) We measure a Si II 6355 velocity of -10,300 km/s. 
(3) The spectrum is a blue featureless continuum. The SN appears to share a host galaxy with SN 2023vuc, and thus we adopt the redshift of z=0.056 (Saccardi et al., 2023, TNSCR, 2725)."

We performed VLBA observations of the candidate PRS associated with FRB20240114A. The source was previously detected with uGMRT and MeerKAT at lower angular resolution (a few arcsec, ATel #16820 and Atel #16695), not allowing to exclude a possible star-formation or diffuse origin. Lately, further e-Merlin observations at 5.5 GHz performed by us resulted in a 50 uJy upper limit (ATel #16864), suggesting a steep spectral index (<-0.6) in the 1.3-5 GHz range, or that the radio emission comes from a diffuse region (>~460 mas corresponding to a physical size >~1 kpc) resolved-out at the resolution of e-Merlin (tens of milli-arcsec). 
  
We observed with the VLBA at 5 GHz (C band), under DDT project BB468 (PI Bruni), pointing at the FRB coordinates from the PRECISE collaboration (ATel #16542). Observations were divided into two runs, on September 28th and 30th, 2024, for a total of 12 hours. Phase referencing was applied. Data were reduced through the standard AIPS procedure for continuum, then calibrated visibilities from the two runs were concatenated and imaged in CASA achieving an angular resolution of 4x2 milli-arcsec in natural weighting. 
  
An unresolved source was identified within the +/-200 mas FRB positional uncertainty provided by the PRECISE collaboration, ~50 mas northwards the phase center. The flux density is ~40 uJy, thus falling below the e-Merlin upper limit at the same frequency from our previous observations (ATel #16864). No other statistically significant peak was found in the uncertainty region from PRECISE. At the redshift of the host galaxy (z=0.13, ATel #16613), the physical size of the PRS is constrained to <~5 pc. 
  
This detection confirms the presence of a compact, continuum source associated with FRB20240114A, making this the fourth PRS known to date - following FRB20121102A (Marcote et al. 2017), FRB20190520B (Bhandari et al. 2023a), and FRB20201124A (Bruni et al. 2024). Results will be discussed in a forthcoming paper (Bruni et al. in prep.).

We report on the detection of a fast radio burst (FRB) originating from the CHIME/FRB-discovered source FRB 20240209A (ATels #16670, #16682, #16687). We detected the burst using the 25-m Westerbork RT-1 telescope observing at a central frequency of 1.27 GHz (L-band) with a 128-MHz bandwidth (see Kirsten et al. 2024 for more details on the observational setup). This detection marks the highest frequency at which the source has been observed, demonstrating that the source is active and detectable at L-band. 
 
The preliminary properties of the burst are: 
Arrival time (MJD, TDB): 60601.595462943 
Fluence: 32 +/- 6 Jy ms 
Dispersion measure (DM): 174.16 +/- 0.1 pc cm^-3 
 
The arrival time is referenced to infinite frequency (using the quoted DM) at the Solar System barycentre (in TDB), and assuming a DM constant of 1/(2.41 x 10^-4) MHz^2 pc^-1 cm^3 s. We estimate the fluence by averaging over the full observing bandwidth and applying the radiometer equation using a system equivalent flux density (SEFD) of 420 Jy. The error on the fluence is roughly 20% and arises from the uncertainty on the SEFD of the telescope. Using the DM reported in the discovery ATel (#16670, 176.57 +/- 0.03 pc cm^-3) to account for the dispersive delay resulted in an overcorrection. The DM we use was determined by the burst-searching algorithm Heimdall. It is not clear yet whether the difference in DM is true temporal evolution or arises from an underlying complex burst structure. The voltage data of the burst was saved, which will allow us to study the full polarimetric properties of the burst with coherent dedispersion. 
 
Since its discovery in June 2024, we have been monitoring this FRB as part of the HyperFlash program (High-Cadence FRB Monitoring with European Radio Dishes). Up to the publication of this ATel, we have accumulated 500 hours of observing time, spread across observations at central frequencies of 330 MHz (P-band, 150h) and 1.4 GHz (L-band, 350h). Our average detection threshold at L-band for the various telescopes is ~6 Jy ms. Thus far, no bursts have been detected at P-band above our detection limit of ~50 Jy ms. We will continue to monitor this source. Besides with CHIME/FRB, FRB 20240209A was so far only reported to be detected by the Northern Cross telescope at a central frequency of 408 MHz (ATel #16692). 
 
Over the past week, FRB 20240209A has been detected multiple times by CHIME/FRB, as reported by the CHIME/FRB VOEvent Service and on their public website. The recent detections by CHIME/FRB, combined with our own, show that the source is in a state of heightened activity across a broad range of radio frequencies. We therefore encourage follow-up observations across all wavelengths.

We performed e-Merlin follow-up observations of the candidate PRS associated with FRB20240114A, recently detected with the uGMRT (ATel #16820) and MeerKAT (Atel #16695). Observations at C band (5 GHz), under project CY18016 (PI Bruni) were carried in five ~12-hour runs between September 20 and 28, 2024, pointing at the FRB coordinates from the PRECISE collaboration (ATel #16542). Phase referencing was applied. Visibilities were calibrated through the e-Merlin pipeline (Moldon 2021, ascl:2109.006), and imaged in CASA. An RMS of 10 uJy/beam was reached, and no source was detected either within the uncertainty region of the FRB coordinates (+/-200 mas), or within the wider image field (20""x20""). This sets a 5-sigma upper limit of 50 uJy for the candidate PRS flux density at 5 GHz. The image resolution in natural weighting was 228x87 mas. 
  
On the basis of previous detections at 650 MHz (uGMRT, 65.6 +/- 8.1 uJy) and 1.3 GHz (MeerKAT, 72 +/- 14 uJy) a flat spectral index and a spectral luminosity of (2.83+/-0.35) x 10^28 erg/s/Hz were estimated (ATel #16820). Nevertheless, in-band spectral analysis of MeerKAT data resulted in a spectral index of -1.1 +/- 0.8 between 1 and 1.5 GHz, suggesting a possible steepening of the radio emission at higher frequencies. Our e-Merlin non-detection at higher angular resolution seems to confirm such steepening, with a spectral index <-0.6 in the 1.3-5 GHz range. Alternatively, the radio emission comes from a diffuse region (>~460 mas corresponding to a physical size >~1 kpc) resolved-out in our high-resolution images, thus falling below the detection threshold. The latter scenario would exclude a possible compact nature of the emission, such as a PRS origin.

In January 2024, the CHIME/FRB Collaboration discovered a repeating FRB 20240114A (ATel #16420). Based on observations from MeerKAT (ATel #16446) and the European Very Long Baseline Interferometry Network (EVN; ATel #16542), FRB 20240114A is localized in the galaxy J212739.84+041945.8 with a redshift of z=0.13 (ATel #16613). The precise localization has helped in detecting extreme burst activity from FRB 20240114A, with bursts detected in a wide frequency range from 300 MHz to 6 GHz using various telescopes (e.g., ATel #16432 , ATel #16452 , ATel #16494 , ATel #16505 , ATel #16597 , ATel #16620), and potentially even with hints of chromaticity (Kumar et al. 2024). 
 
Many studies were conducted to search for any co-located continuum radio emission (e.g., Kumar et al. 2024 and Panda et al. 2024). Recently,  Zhang et al. 2024 (Atel #16695) detected a radio continuum source at L-band using MeerKAT, potentially a persistent radio source (PRS). Here, we report an 8-sigma detection of this potential PRS associated with FRB 20240114A at 650 MHz using uGMRT. We combined observations from 4 epochs between 14 June and 22 August 2024 amounting to a total on-source time of 10 hours. The imaging was performed using the CAPTURE pipeline (Kale et al. 2021). We detected a point source with a peak flux density of 65.6+/-8.1 micro-Jy. The location of this point source coincides with the location of the FRB. The estimated spectral luminosity is (2.83+/-0.35) x 10^28 erg/s/Hz, which is an order of magnitude fainter when compared to that of the PRSs associated with FRB 20121102A and FRB 20190520B. Our flux density measurement at 650 MHz combined with that at L-band from ATel #16695 , suggests a flat spectral index. A deep VLBI observation would help in constraining the compactness and confirming whether the emission is indeed due to an underlying PRS associated with FRB 20240114A.  
 
We thank the staff of the GMRT for their support and assistance with these observations. We acknowledge the prompt approval and scheduling of the DDT observations allowing us to do this study. The GMRT is run by the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.

IceCube has performed a search for track-like muon neutrino events arriving from the direction of the magnetar 1E 1841-045 during its recent outburst (Swift-BAT ATel #16784, Fermi-GBM ATel #16786). The search was performed using a time window of four days (2024-08-20 04:00:00.0 UTC to 2024-08-24 04:00:00.0 UTC), during which IceCube was collecting good quality data. This time window includes the first detection of activity by Swift-BAT and activity detected by Fermi-GBM.   
 
We find that the data are consistent with atmospheric background expectations, with a p-value of 1.0. We accordingly derive a time-integrated muon-neutrino flux upper limit for this source of E^2 dN/ dE = 3.4 x 10^-2 GeV cm^-2 at 90% CL, under the assumption of an E^-2 power law. The central 90% energy range of events IceCube would detect from a source at this declination with an E^-2 spectrum is approximately 2 TeV to 80 PeV.

After the announcement of a strong Gamma-ray flare of the Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar B2 1015+35B in ATel #16812 we observed the source with the 30cm telescope of the Santa Lucia di Stroncone Observatory (MPC 589) on 2024-09-14 (MJD 60567) with the R and I (Cousins) filters, respectively for 3000 s and 480 s. Nearby comparison stars were taken from the PanStarrs DR1 catalog (VIZIER II/349, Chambers+ 2016) adopting their rmag and imag magnitudes. Several satellite tracks are present in our images, but luckily they do not cross the Quasar. 
B2 1015+35B was detected at rmag=17.15 +/-0.07, imag=16.89 +/-0.11. The PanStarrs catalog values are rmag=17.72, imag=17.85, likely not simultaneous. 
The light curve of the source, available since October 2015 from the ATLAS forced photometry service, shows a slow monotonic luminosity increase with some flares of about half magnitude and about one month long, but stops on June 2024 due to the solar conjunction. A linear extrapolation of the trend to the present date gives rmag=17.28, which is not very different from the observed value. 
The Quasar reached rmag=16.8 on previous flares (MJD 59304, 59667, 60073), when no Gamma-ray flares were detected by Fermi-LAT according to ATel #16812: the observed present value suggests therefore that there is no correlation between the optical and the Gamma-ray luminosity of the source, at variance with most BL Lac objects."

The classifications were performed with SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024).

Since the reported bursting activity of the magnetar 1E 1841-045 with Swift-BAT (ATEL #16784), Fermi-GBM (ATEL #16786), and NICER (ATEL #16789), we have acquired more NICER observations of the target, covering the time period 2024 August 20 at 23:28 to 2024 August 31 at 10:58 UT, for a total exposure of 27.6 ks. Additionally, we acquired a NuSTAR Directors Discretionary Time observation starting on 2024 August 29 at 04:21 UT for a total exposure of approximately 50 ks. Lastly, we analyze the Swift-XRT photon counting mode observation acquired beginning 2024-08-22 at 03:52 UT for a total of 1.8 ks.

The NICER monitoring shows that the source bursting activity has strongly diminished since August 20. We detect only two faint bursts in addition to the ones reported in ATEL #16789.

Preliminary phase-averaged spectral analysis, utilizing the NuSTAR and Swift-XRT imaging observations, shows that the spectra can be well modeled with an absorbed blackbody (BB) and double power-law (PL) model, in line with other magnetars (C-stat of 1887 for 1824 degrees-of-freedom). The photon indices Γ for the soft and hard PLs are 3.5±0.2 and 1.26±0.03, whereas the temperature of the BB is 0.41±0.02 keV. We find a 2-79 keV absorption corrected flux of 1.3 × 10-10 erg/s/cm2, and a hard PL flux in the 3-79 keV range of about 9.3 × 10-11 erg/s/cm2. The latter flux is a factor of 2 larger than the corresponding historical measurement established with XRT+NuSTAR (e.g., An, H. et al. 2015 ApJ, 807, 93A). We verified this assertion through our own analysis of the archival NuSTAR observation (ID 30001025002) and XRT observation (ID 00080220003), which indeed confirms the factor 2 elevated flux level in the most recent data.

The 10-day NICER baseline allowed us to establish an accurate timing solution for the post-outburst data. We find a pulsation frequency of 0.0846995(1) Hz and a frequency derivative of -2.9(4)× 10-13 Hz s-1 (reference time 60550 MJD). Comparing this solution to the long-term NICER and XRT monitoring of the source shows no evidence of a glitch so far, however, a longer baseline is required to establish the post-outburst timing behavior of the source.

Folding the post-outburst NICER and NuSTAR data utilizing the above timing solution shows a multi-peaked, complex pulse profile in the 2-8 keV range that significantly differs from the pre-outburst profile. Similarly, the NuSTAR 10-30 keV profile exhibits complex structure, differing from the profile in soft X-rays, as well as from the historical measurement (An, H. et al. 2015 ApJ, 807, 93A).

We note that, to our knowledge, this is the first time that radiative changes are reported for this magnetar following bursting activity (e.g., Dib, R. & Kaspi, V. M. 2014, ApJ, 784, 37). We encourage continued X-ray and multiwavelength monitoring to study the evolution of this outburst.

We graciously thank the NICER, NuSTAR, and Swift teams for approving and promptly executing our observational requests."

We observed the target three times: 35 min starting from UTC2024-08-23 13:17:00, 60~min starting from UTC2024-08-29 11:49:00, and 30 min starting from UTC2024-09-01 11:40:00 with 49.152 us time resolution and a 0.122 MHz channelization in the 1.05-1.45GHz band. We detected no significant radio burst with dispersion measure between 5 and 5000 pc cm^{-3} and an S/N>7 sigma, equivalent to a burst fluence limit of about 17.5 mJy ms for a fiducial burst width of 1 ms. We also searched for pulsed radio emission with the spin period of the magnetar (11.8 s). We found no significant signal with S/N>5, equivalent to a pulsed flux limit of 11 uJy, assuming a fiducial pulse duty cycle of 10 percent. Our results indicate that the magnetar was probably not active in Radio when we observed it; we will continue observing this target."

Swift/BAT reported the detection of possible burst activity from 1E 1841-045 at 19:01:18 UT on 2024 August 20 (GCN #37211). A subsequent notice reported three additional bursts detected by Swift/BAT over the next 24 hours, suggesting that the source has entered a bursting phase for the first time since Swift/BAT last detected it in 2016 (GCN #37222, ATel #16784). Follow-up Fermi/GBM observations detected 8 bursts, 3 of which were also reported by Swift/BAT (GCNs #37222, #37234, ATel #16786). Supplementing its biweekly monitoring campaign, NICER triggered observations of 1E 1841-045 starting on 2024 August 20 at 23:28 UT for a total exposure time of 4.6 ks.

NICER data show a 0.4-10.0 keV persistent count rate of 15.0 ± 0.2 c/s (52-detector normalized) in the first good time interval (GTI), which includes the magnetar and contamination from the surrounding supernova remnant Kes 73. In the GTI starting on 2024 August 21 at 10:22 UT, the source exhibited sporadic burst activity lasting for around 300 s, and peaking at around 220 c/s. We detected 8 burst candidates using the Bayesian blocks technique; their properties are listed below. The source returned to its persistent count rate of 15.34 ± 0.15 c/s, immediately after the bursting interval, consistent with the first GTI. The previous NICER observation on August 3 exhibited a slightly higher count rate of 16.18 ± 0.13 c/s.

We performed preliminary timing analysis with the most recent NICER observation on 2024 August 3, as well as on the data from the latest trigger. We find a signature of the pulse profile changing from a doubly-peaked profile in the August 3 data to singly-peaked in the latest trigger. Details of the timing analysis will be reported elsewhere.

In order to characterize the persistent emission of the source, we extracted an X-ray spectrum using the data obtained across the first ~2.8 hours of the NICER observation (resulting in a 1087 s exposure), during which no obvious bursting activity was observed. To take into account the X-ray emission of the surrounding supernova remnant (Kes 73), we used a template spectral model (containing absorbed VPSHOCK and NEI components) based on Chandra archival data. For the magnetar emission, we used a power-law model. The best-fit photon index is found to be Γ = 3.07 ± 0.11 and the 0.5-10.0 keV absorbed source flux is 5.94 ± 0.10 × 10-11 erg/s/cm2. Using the same approach, we also analyzed the August 3 data and inferred an absorbed 0.5-10.0 keV flux of 4.79 ± 0.07 × 10-11 erg/s/cm2 with a similar photon index value. The change in the source flux implies a roughly 25% increase in the persistent emission of the magnetar.

NICER will continue to observe 1E 1841-045/Kes 73 while the burst activity persists. The latest schedule is available at https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/nicer/schedule/nicer_sts_current.html. We encourage multiwavelength observations with other facilities.

NICER is a 0.2-12 keV X-ray telescope operating on the International Space Station. The NICER mission and portions of the NICER science team activities are funded by NASA.

located the soft gamma repeater SGR 1E 1841-045 / Kes 73 (trigger=1249878). 
Swift did not slew immediately to this source. 
The BAT on-board calculated location is 
RA, Dec 280.344, -4.950 which is 
  RA(J2000) = 18h 41m 22s 
  Dec(J2000) = -04d 57' 00"" 
with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% containment, including 
systematic uncertainty).  The BAT light curve showed a single spike 
structure with a duration of about 0.2 sec.  The peak count rate 
was ~100k counts/sec (15-350 keV), at ~0 sec after the trigger. 
 
Because Swift did not slew, there is no immediate UVOT or XRT data. 
However a Target Of Opportunity observation is currently scheduled 
for 3:50 on 2024-08-22 UT. 
 
This follows a previously-reported burst from this source 25 hours earlier 
(GCN #37211) and two additional bursts detected since then, indicating that 
this source has entered a bursting phase.  This is the first BAT-detected 
activity from this source since 2016.  The current BAT catalog of burst

In Atel #16734, the CHIME/FRB Collaboration reported the discovery of a new, active repeating source, FRB 20240316A. Here, we report additional bursts from this source and provide an updated position using the CHIME/FRB raw voltage system (herein referred to as the 'baseband' system).

Below are all additional bursts detected by CHIME/FRB from this source since 2024-07-25 with S/N > 8. The burst arrival times (topocentric at CHIME near Penticton, Canada at 400 MHz) are from the real-time detection system and subject to optimization following proper burst fitting. No bursts from this source with S/N > 8 were detected with CHIME/FRB between 2024-08-05 and 2024-08-19. However, we detected a burst from this source on 2024-08-20, suggesting the source may be turning on again.

Based on the baseband data of FRB 20240726C, we obtain a structure-maximizing dispersion measure of 351 +/- 1 pc cm-3. We determine an improved localization for the source using the baseband data from FRB 20240722B, FRB 20240724F, FRB 20240724L, FRB 20240726C, and FRB 20240805B. Our analysis gives an inverse-variance weighted best position of RA (J2000): 354.57 +/- 0.01 deg (23h38m16.8s), Dec (J2000): 32.33 +/- 0.01 deg (32d19m48s), with errors quoted at a 90% certainty level (Michilli et al. 2021 ApJ, 910, 147). We do not differentiate between systematic and random uncertainties when determining the inverse-variance weighted best position.

Using the PATH formalism (Aggarwal et al. 2021 ApJ, 911, 95), the combined best-fit localization, and archival data from the DECaLS survey, we found two possible hosts, but neither has P(O|x) > 0.8. An improved localization is required in order to identify the host galaxy of this source.

A preliminary polarimetric analysis of the voltage data gives an average Faraday rotation measure (RM) of ~160 rad/m^2 (Mckinven et al. 2021 ApJ, 920, 138). We also obtained preliminary fluences (averaged over the entire 400-800 MHz CHIME observing band) ranging from 4.6 +/- 0.6 Jy ms for FRB 20240805B to 27 +/- 3 Jy ms for FRB 20240726C.

We note that the majority of bursts from this source have been detected in the lower half of the CHIME/FRB bandwidth (e.g., 400 - 600 MHz) and follow-up at lower frequencies could be fruitful. Bursts show a range of morphology with some bursts having multiple components and signs of downward drifting."

We report the classifications of astrophysical transients from spectroscopic observations with the Kast spectrograph on the Shane telescope obtained on 2024 July 07 UT. The targets were supplied by ASAS-SN and ZTF, and identified using the target management platform YSE-PZ (Coulter et al., 2023, PASP, 135, 4501). The classifications were performed with SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024).

Notes: 
When the redshift is given to 2 decimal places, it is derived from the SN spectrum. Otherwise, the redshift is determined from the host galaxy. 
(1) We subtract an S0 galaxy template spectrum (Kinney et al., 1996, ApJ, 467, 38) and recover a broad H-alpha P-Cyngi feature. The flux below ~6000 A is consistent with solely host galaxy emission.  
(2) We measure a Si II 6355 absorption velocity of -19,200 km/s."

We report the detection of bright soft X-ray emission with Swift-XRT at the location of AT2024qfm (M. Fulton et al., Astro Note 2024-206). A soft X-ray source is detected  with an approximate count-rate of  1e-2 c/s (0.3-10 keV), which corresponds to an approximate flux of 5e-13 erg/cm2/s. For the SDSS photometric redshift of z = 0.19 +/- 0.05, and an assumed power-law spectrum with photon index Gamma=2, the corresponding luminosity is ~5e+43 erg/s. As of a few days after peak, and if physically associated with AT2024qfm,  this would make AT2024qfm more X-ray luminous than the prototypical FBOT event AT2018cow, but less luminous than other FBOTs  (e.g., Migliori et al., ApJL, 963, 24).  Further X-ray observations will map the temporal evolution of this source."

We report the detection of 60 bursts from the recently discovered repeating FRB, FRB 20240916D (ATel #16690), using the uGMRT. Observations were conducted at band 4 (550 - 750 MHz) with a time resolution of 0.33 ms in phased-array mode on July 25, 2024, and July 29, 2024, with on-source times of 40 and 134 minutes, respectively.  
 
 
We searched for bursts above a S/N threshold of 7 in a dispersion measure (DM) range of 460 to 480 pc cm^-3  for the 25th July session, and at the structure optimized DM of 464.87 pc cm^-3 (as reported in ATel #16732) for the 29th July session. Widths of the detected bursts range from 2 ms to 21 ms, based on the FWHM of a Gaussian fit to the SNR-optimized temporal profiles of bursts in the 25th July session. Using the radiometer equation, we measure the fluence of the brightest burst detected on 29th July to be 2.8 Jy ms, with a typical uncertainty of 10%. We estimate the burst rate from the 29th July session (using only the scans where the phased-array beam was not affected by scintillation) to be approximately 28 bursts per hour above a fluence threshold of 0.23 Jy ms (corresponding to a 8-sigma detection for a 2 ms wide burst). The bursts show band-limited emission and frequency drifting, which are typical characteristics of repeating FRBs. We also obtained preliminary estimates of the structure-optimized DM for two bursts to be 465.48 +/- 0.06 pc cm^-3 and 465.11 +/- 0.05 pc cm^-3 using DM-phase (Seymour 2019). 
 
 
The above burst rate at 650 MHz suggests that the source is still highly active at lower frequencies, and further follow-up observations at multiple wavelengths, particularly at lower radio frequencies, are encouraged. 
 
 
We would like to thank the Director and the operations group of the observatory for the prompt time-allocation and scheduling of our observations. GMRT is run by the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research."

The CHIME/FRB Collaboration reports a sudden high activity state from a repeating source of fast radio bursts (FRB 20240316A). 
Before this state of high activity, CHIME/FRB detected four bursts in November and December of 2023 and one in March of 2024. 
However, since 2024-07-22 at 11:29:43 UTC, twenty-two bursts have been detected from the source, nine of which were broadcast through CHIMEâs Virtual Observatory Event Service. 
Four bursts were detected in 6 minutes on 2024-07-22, five bursts were detected in 13 minutes on 2024-07-23, and thirteen bursts were detected in 18 minutes on 2024-07-24.

The above approximate UTC burst times at 400 MHz (topocentric at CHIME near Penticton, Canada) are from the real-time detection system and subject to optimization following proper burst fitting.

Based on the intensity data of FRB 20240724M, we obtain a localization of RA (J2000): 354.58 +/- 0.07 deg (23h38m19.1s), Dec (J2000): 32.38 +/- 0.06 deg (32d22m48.00s) using the intensity localization method for sidelobe-detected events from Lin et al. (2023, arXiv:2307.05261). 
Errors in this position are quoted at 90% a confidence level.

We encourage rapid follow-up, especially radio interferometric observations to further localize FRB 20240316A."

We report on the detection of a bright burst originating from the MeerKAT-discovered, repeating FRB 20240619D (ATel #16690) using the Westerbork RT-1 25-m telescope at a central frequency of 1.27 GHz (L-band) and with 128-MHz bandwidth.  
 
The preliminary properties of the burst are: 
Arrival time (MJD, TDB): 60511.994415889  
Fluence: 690 +/- 138 Jy ms  
Dispersion measure (DM): 464.87 +/- 0.11 pc cm^-3  
 
 
Due to the high signal-to-noise ratio and the presence of sharp features (< 200 microsec) in the burst we are able to accurately and precisely determine the DM by making use of the structure-optimizing code DM-phase (Seymour 2019). We note that the burst is broadened due to dispersive smearing within the channels. The residual smearing within a frequency channel ranges from ~101 microsec at the top to ~137 microsec at the bottom of the observing band. The voltage data of the burst was saved, which will allow us to study the burst at higher time resolution with coherent dedispersion. 
 
Our reported DM is ~15 units lower compared to the DMs (486.8, 480.7 and 471.9 pc cm^-3) of the bursts reported by the MeerTRAP team (ATel #16690). These three previous DM values were determined by maximizing the relatively low signal-to-noise ratio of unstructured bursts, and may therefore overestimate the dispersion measure. 
 
The arrival time is referenced to infinite frequency at the Solar System barycentre (in TDB), and assuming a DM constant of 1/(2.41 x 10^-4) MHz^2 pc^-1 cm^3 s. We measure the fluence of the burst by averaging over the entire observing bandwidth and applying the radiometer equation using a system equivalent flux density (SEFD) of 420 Jy. The error on the fluence is roughly 20% and arises from the uncertainty on the SEFD of the telescope. 
 
As a result of the low elevation of the source, we are only able to observe for ~3 hours per day. Up until the burst detection we observed for 26 hours at L-band and 22 hours at P-band (0.33 GHz). Our detection thresholds for 8-sigma events correspond to a fluence of ~10 Jy ms for L-band and ~80 Jy ms for P-band. Thus far we have not detected a burst at P-band. The detection of a bright burst after limited exposure hours (and with relatively low sensitivity) could indicate that the source is highly active. We therefore encourage follow-up observations at all wavelengths.

We conducted four hours of radio follow-up observations FRB 20240209A with the Very Large Array (VLA) and the realfast transient search system (program code 24A-486; PI Law). The observations were done in two, 2-hour segments on July 2 and July 5, in response to recent activity reported by CHIME/FRB (ATel #16670). The realfast system observed from 1-2 GHz with a sampling time of 10 ms and a field of view that included the CHIME/FRB localization uncertainty. No bursts were detected to a limiting sensitivity of approximately 0.9 Jy ms (8 sigma).

In parallel with the fast transient search, we recorded slow visibility data suitable for sensitive radio imaging to search for a persistent radio counterpart to the FRB. Using one of the two data sets, we generate images of the FRB localization region, including the candidate host galaxy, PSO J289.8503+86.0609 (ATel #16682). We identify only one radio source in the 3sigma localization region and it is coincident with the candidate host galaxy. The radio source has an integrated flux of 265+-56, 204+-43, 112 +- 25 microJy at of 1.16, 1.48, and 1.84 GHz, respectively.

The radio source location is 19:19:24.15 +- 0.02, 86:03:39.7 +- 0.5  (at 1.84 GHz) and has a full-width at half-maximum ellipse of (7.1"", 3.5"", -25 deg). The position and shape are consistent with an unresolved source at or near the nucleus of proposed host galaxy. At the redshift of the candidate FRB host galaxy (ATel #16686), the flux density of the radio emission corresponds to a radio luminosity of ~1e29 erg/s/Hz. New observations will be required to associate the FRB to radio counterpart, as well as distinguish the radio counterpart from star-formation or nuclear emission in the proposed host galaxy.

We thank the NRAO director for approving of this discretionary time request."

FRB 20240114A is a repeating FRB discovered by the CHIME/FRB Collaboration (ATel #16420) in January 2024. Follow-up radio observations with multiple telescopes have revealed its hyperactive bursting nature with bursts detected in the frequency range from a few hundreds of MHz up to 6 GHz (e.g., ATel #16432, ATel #16452, ATel #16505, ATel #16597, ATel #16620). Based on the precise localisation of FRB 20240114A achieved with MeerKAT (ATel #16446) and EVN (ATel #16542) observations, its likely host galaxy J212739.84+041945.8 at a redshift of z=0.13 (ATel #16613) (at a luminosity distance of ~610 Mpc) was confidently measured. Efforts on searching for its X-ray (ATel #16645) and radio continuum counterparts (ATel #16452; Panda et al. 2024, arXiv:2405.09749; Kumar et al. 2024, arXiv:2406.12804) were conducted, but only upper limits were reported as of yet. Surprisingly, enhanced gamma-ray activities and a GeV gamma-ray flare coincident with the direction of the FRB (ATel #16594, ATel #16630) were identified in Fermi-LAT data.

During the active bursting phase soon after the discovery of FRB 20240114A, two bursts were detected and reported at L-band (ATel #16446) from the MeerKAT DDT observation performed on February 9, 2024, by MeerTrap team. We analyzed the public data with visibilities of 2s integration time of the observation (see (ATel #16446) for details), and found a radio continuum counterpart with a source position of (R.A., Dec.) [J2000] = (21h27m39.82s, 4d19m47.106s) with 1 sigma statistical uncertainty of (0.65 arcsec, 0.89 arcsec), which is spatially coincident with the FRB positions given by MeerKAT (looks slightly offset from that reported from EVN (ATel #16542), in which the position might have been distorted by sidelobe structure). The measured flux density is 72 +/- 14 microJy (spectral luminosity of L_1.3GHz=3.2*10^{28} erg s^{-1} Hz^{-1} at the luminosity distance of 610 Mpc) with an in-band spectrum index of -1.1 +/- 0.8 using source detections of 92 +/- 17 microJy at 1.07 GHz and 64 +/- 14 microJy at 1.50 GHz.

Therefore, the radio continuum source is very likely the persistent radio source (PRS) of the FRB, thus the FRB is similar to other PRS-FRB associations, or at least a Transient Radio Source (TRS) in association with the FRB that has not been seen before. This mysterious, luminous radio source therefore potentially enlarge the sample of FRB-PRS association or alternatively provide potential new clues to the evolution of FRBs.

We would like to thank the staff at the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory (SARAO) and the MeerTrap team for making the observations and data publicly available."

The Northern Cross FRB collaboration reports the detection of a burst from the recently announced FRB repeater FRB 20240209A (ATel #16670). 
 
We observed the source from 2024-07-01 to 2024-07-04 for a total on-source time of 20 hours. Observations were carried out with a 16 MHz bandwidth at a central frequency of 408 MHz, with a 14.468 kHz channel width and a 138.24 μs sampling time. 
The FRB search was performed using Heimdall (Barsdell et al. 2012) and FETCH (Agarwal et al. 2020) spanning a DM range between 160 and 200 pc cm−3 with signal-to-noise ratio > 7. 
 
The topocentric arrival time of the burst is 2024-07-02 21:24:24.540 UTC at 400 MHz at Medicina and the correspondent TDB at infinite frequency is 2024-07-02 21:22:42.718 UTC. 
The inferred DM for the burst was 176.56 pc cm−3, which is consistent with the previously reported detections (ATel #16670). 
The burst has a fluence of ∼ 90.5 ± 6.3 Jy ms and the best Gaussian fit of the peak returns a full width at half maximum of 11.9 &plusmn 1.4 ms. 
 
We will continue the monitoring over the next weeks.

The MeerTRAP team reports the discovery of a new repeating FRB source, FRB 20240619D. We detected three bursts within 2 minutes on 2024 June 19 with signal to noise ratios (S/Ns) of 28, 22 and 14, respectively. MeerKAT was operating in a sub-array mode at the time and 32 dishes were included in the sub-array which detected the FRB. All three bursts triggered channelised voltage data from the individual MeerKAT antennas, which we used to initially localise the FRB in the image domain using our transient buffer imaging pipeline (Rajwade et al. 2024; also see Rajwade et al. 2020). This FRB source is highly active given the limited exposure of MeerKAT at the source position (~2 minutes on 2024 June 19), as confirmed by further follow-up. A further investigation of archival MeerKAT observations of the field revealed two observations of similar duration in 2024 that did not reveal any bursts. The dynamic spectra of the three bursts are shown in the link below.

The three bursts occurred at 2024-06-19 00:41:01, 00:41:17, and 00:42:13 UTC (topocentric, at the top of the MeerKAT L-band which spans  856 - 1712 MHz). The S/N maximising DMs of the three bursts are 486.8, 480.7 and 471.9 pc cm^-3, respectively. A preliminary analysis of the voltage data shows that the brightest burst has a Faraday rotation measure of RM ~177 rad/m^2.

We carried out a 2h follow-up observation of FRB 20240619D with MeerKAT, 1h at L-band and 1h at S-band (1968 - 2843MHz), on 2024 June 26 at 00:09 UTC as part of a Director's Discretionary Time Proposal (proposal id: DDT-20240625-JT-01). The average burst rate observed at L-band and S-band is >70/h and >26/h, respectively, above a ~1 Jy ms fluence threshold. The best localisation was achieved using the voltage data of a bright burst detected at S-band at 2024-06-26 02:18:30 UTC, giving RA = 19:49:29.21, Dec = -25:12:49.40 with a 1-sigma uncertainty of 0.7 arcsec in RA and Dec. The localisation of the burst can be seen in the link below.

We find two optical sources in the images from the DESI Legacy Survey DR10 (Dey et al. 2019) near the FRB location, S1 at RA = 19:49:29.38, Dec = -25:12:48.80 and S2 at RA = 19:49:29.03, Dec = -25:12:47.77. No redshift information is available for these two sources. FRB 20240619D could potentially be associated with either of them or an even fainter galaxy. An extended radio source that we identify as AGN J194930.09-251338.6 from the Million Quasars catalogue is centred ~50 arcsec away from the FRB location. If this source is in the foreground of the FRB host, it could contribute to the observed DM and RM. Given that FRB 20240619D is likely still active now, we encourage further observations.

We would like to thank the Director and the operators of MeerKAT and the South African Radio 
Astronomy Observatory (SARAO) for the prompt scheduling of the observation. The MeerKAT telescope is operated by SARAO, which is a facility of the National Research Foundation, an agency of the Department of Science and Innovation.

The CHIME/FRB Collaboration reports on optical spectroscopy of the most probable host galaxy for the active repeating FRB 20240209A (ATel #16670, ATel #16682). We obtained 2x180-sec of observations of the putative host galaxy, PSO J289.8503+86.0609, of FRB 20240209A with the LRIS optical spectrograph mounted on the Keck I telescope at Mauna Kea, Hawaii on 29 June, 2024 UT (PI: A. Miller). Observations were taken at an airmass of 2.47 in ~1 arcsec seeing, covering approximately 3300-10200 Ang. We detect several absorption features including CaII H&K, Mg, NaD, and TiO, as well as a strong 4000 Ang break, at a common redshift of z=0.1384 +/- 0.0004. The observed spectral features, coupled with the lack of strong emission lines, are indicative of a quiescent host galaxy for the repeating FRB 20240209A.

We thank Chang Liu (Northwestern) for initial, rapid reduction and consultation on the spectrum, and the Keck Observatory staff Sherry Yeh and Tony Connors for supporting the scheduled observations."

The CHIME/FRB Collaboration reports an improved position for the new, highly-active repeater FRB 20240209A, achieved through VLBI with the first of three CHIME/FRB Outrigger telescopes, KKO. The 66-km baseline formed by CHIME and KKO is capable of ~ arcsecond-scale precision along the baseline axis, which mostly constrains the RA of the source (Lanman et al., 2024). The localizations found through this analysis further support the association of this repeater with the galaxy PSO J289.8503+86.0609, as initially reported in ATEL #16670.

We have localized two bursts from FRB 20240209A, which have TNS names FRB 20240209A and FRB 20240309A (hereafter, bursts 1 and 2, respectively). Our 1 sigma likelihood contours are reported as ellipses, with semimajor and semiminor axes ""a_error"" and ""b_error"", respectively, and a position angle ""theta"".

FRB 20240209A (burst 1):

FRB 20240309A (burst 2):

We form station beams using the baseband data  from CHIME and KKO toward the best-fit position from the baseband analysis (""baseband position""), as well as to multiple calibrator positions that were in-beam at the time. We then cross-correlated each pointing using our software correlator PyFX (Leung et al. 2024) to form visibilities, and phase-referenced the FRB visibilities to J0117+8928, a bright VLBA calibrator about 3.9&deg away from the baseband position. Since the bursts are inherently narrow-band, we mask out off-burst parts of the band after cross-correlating. We mask out frequencies from 500 to 800 MHz for burst 1 and from 400-630 and 690-800 MHz for burst 2. This masking increased the cross-correlation S/N to ~ 25 in the XX polarization and 28 in YY for burst 1, and 22 and 13 for burst 2.

To solve for the position, we computed geometric delays for a grid of positions throughout the baseband localization region using the CALC11 delay model, as implemented in pycalc11. Combining the baseband localization region (from ATEL #16670) with the VLBI constraints yields the localization contours shown in the attached figures. The red circle marks the location and apparent width of the likely host galaxy.

We expect ionospheric effects to be negligible on the 66-km CHIME — KKO baseline, especially for target-calibrator separations as low as 4&deg. Therefore, we perform a delay-mapping analysis to accurately measure the true position. We inflate b_error to 4"" to account for the small signal bandwidth (see Fig 17 of Lanman et al.,  2024). Full details of the VLBI analysis pipeline may be found in Leung et al. (2024) and its application to the CHIME — KKO baseline is demonstrated in Lanman et al. (2024).

We received an alert about a candidate fast transient from the FINK broker (Peloton, Ishida & Moller et al.) on 2024-06-22 09:58:42.001 UTC, named ZTF24aasjjkf (https://fink-portal.org/ZTF24aasjjkf). 
This transient was classified by FINK on the same day with a 17 percent probability of being a fast transient. We triggered the TAROT-TCA and  TRT-SRO telescopes for further investigation, observing in the R, r', and i' bands, and collecting data from 2024-06-23 around 04:55:14 UTC to 2024-06-24 01:00:00 UTC. 
Our results, along with public ZTF data, can be found here: 
https://skyportal-icare.ijclab.in2p3.fr/public/sources/ZTF24aasjjkf/version/07cf393bb53513abe80d3b7863938d8f 
TAROT-TCA telescope observations can be also labeled as ""generic"" in the plot. 
We utilized STDWeb (Karpov et al.) to perform our photometry, using the Pan-STARRS DR1 (PS1) catalog and subtracting the constant flux of background with a reference PS1 image. 
We note that in the TAROT-TCA data, we have slight contamination from other stars. However, we mitigated this effect by subtracting the PS1 reference image. 
According to the ZTF data in the r' band, both before and after our observations, as well as ATLAS data (in the orange band) and the Gaia Alert (2024LXA), the source might be 10 days old or more. Its multi-band light curve is not consistent with a fast transient like a kilonova (a decay rate of 0.15 per day in r-band) but resembles a supernova (also classified by FINK on 2024-06-24 at 08:00 UTC). The source has been independently classified by Jianlin Xu et al. as a CV. 
We thank the FINK team for their valuable collaboration with GRANDMA.

The CHIME/FRB Collaboration reports the discovery of a new, active repeating source of FRBs (FRB 20240209A). We have detected fifteen bursts from this repeater since its discovery on 2024-02-09 at 07:10:14 UTC. A recent high activity of the repeater has been observed with six bursts detected over three consecutive days between 2024-06-19 and 2024-06-21, prior to the CHIME/FRB detection system being offline for maintenance. This source is at a declination of ~86 degrees, where CHIME’s limited mean daily exposure (FWHM of the beams at 600 MHz) of ~40 mins indicates a burst rate as high as ~100 bursts per day above a ~1 Jy ms fluence threshold.

The above approximate UTC burst times at 400 MHz (topocentric at CHIME near Penticton, Canada) are from the real-time detection system and subject to optimization following proper burst fitting.

Based on the voltage data of the brightest burst, we obtained a structure-maximizing dispersion measure (DM) of 176.57(3) pc cm^-3. The maximum NE2001/YMW16 Galactic disk DM contribution in the direction of the source is ~56/53 pc cm^-3. A 90% upper limit on redshift of the source is estimated to be z ~ 0.13 (Bhardwaj et al. 2021 ApJL, 919, L24).

The best-fit localization was performed on the CHIME voltage data of seven bursts, giving an inverse-variance weighted best position of RA (J2000): 289.9160 +- 0.0044 deg (19h19m39.84s +- 15.28s), Dec (J2000): 86.0623 +- 0.0046 deg (86d03m44.28s +- 16.56s), with errors quoted at 1-sigma uncertainty (Michilli et al. 2021 ApJ, 910, 147). Using the PATH formalism (Aggarwal et al. 2021 ApJ, 911, 95) and the combined best-fit localization, we identified the galaxy PSO J289.8503+86.0609 as the most probable (P(O|x) = 0.98) host galaxy for this repeater. PATH was run using default priors with P(U) = 0.2 on the relevant PanSTARRS1 field. The galaxy has RA (J2000): 289.8503 deg (19h19m24.07s), Dec (J2000): 86.0609 deg (86d03m39.24s), a photometric redshift of ~ 0.13 from PS1-STRM consistent with the 90% upper-limit on z, and an extinction-corrected r-band magnitude of 17.3 (AB).

A preliminary polarimetric analysis of the voltage data gives a Faraday rotation measure (|RM|) of 6.9 +- 0.5 rad/m^2 and 3.5 +- 0.5 rad/m^2 (there is a sign ambiguity because of cable delay effects; Mckinven et al. 2021 ApJ, 920, 138), and degree of linear polarization ~80% and ~50%, for bursts FRB 20240209A and FRB 20240612A, respectively. The other five bursts with voltage data are unpolarized, with an upper-limit of L/I < 40%.

We also obtained preliminary fluences (averaged over the entire 400-800 MHz CHIME observing band) ranging from 450 +- 46 Jy ms for burst FRB 20240209A to 2.5 +- 0.4 Jy ms for burst FRB 20240612B.

We encourage rapid follow-up, especially radio interferometric observations to further localize FRB 20240209A.

This transient was classified by Fink on the same day as having an 80 percent probability of being a supernova.

We utilized STDWeb (Karpov et al.) to perform our photometry, using the Pan-STARRS DR1 (PS1) catalog and subtracting the constant flux of the galaxy with a reference PS1 image. 
 
While the residual from the transient is detectable in the r' band , the photometry of the i band substracted image is uncertain due to the difficulty to remove the galaxy constant flux. 
 
According to ZTF data in the r' band, before and after the TCH observations, we conclude that the rising slope of the transient is consistent with a supernovan and therefore, we classify as well ZTF24aashinc as a supernova.

We report the discovery of late-time radio emission from the TDE AT2018fyk with the MeerKAT radio telescope at 1.36 GHz. AT2018fyk/ ASASSN-18ul (RA: 22:50:16.090, Dec: -44:51:53.50) was first detected by the All Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASASSN) on September 8, 2018 at a distance of 270 Mpc (Wevers 2019).  The TDE was UV and X-ray bright for the first 500 days. Subsequent dimming at 600 days and rebrightening at 1200 days in X-rays have led to speculation that AT2018fyk could be a partial TDE (Wevers 2023).   
 
In radio, several ATCA observations in the first ~600 days post-discovery at 21 GHz and 7.5 GHz yielded non-detections (Wevers 2019, Wevers 2021).  We first observed AT2018fyk with MeerKAT on May 8, 2021 (days since disruption, t_d = 973 days) at 1.36 GHz resulting in a 3sigma upper limit of <0.06 mJy (Cendes 2024, in press).  A subsequent L-band MeerKAT observation on January 25, 2023 (t_d = 1601 days) resulted in a 3sigma upper limit of <0.04 mJy (Cendes 2024, in press).  However, a recent L-band MeerKAT observation on Feb 20, 2024 (t_d = 1991 days; program: SCI-20230907-YC-01) resulted in a clear detection of AT2018fyk of 0.087 +/- 0.013 mJy at 1.36 GHz, indicating a brightening by a factor of at least 2x  in ~1 year.  A subsequent observation on May 15, 2024 (t_d = 2086 days; DDT-20240522-YC-01) yielded a detection of 0.0531 +/- 0.0131 mJy. 
 
Further observations with MeerKAT and ATCA are ongoing; multi-wavelength observations (particularly in X-ray) are encouraged.  We thank the MeerKAT observatory and staff for coordinating these observations."

We report of the observations campaign with Swift XRT and UVOT instruments of the repeating Fast Radio Burst source FRB20240114A (J2000 R.A., Dec.= 321.9160, 4.3293 deg) during a time interval when the source was reported to be in a radio activity phase (ATels #16597, #16599), with some radio bursts detected just before Swift observations (on May 5th, private communication) and some further bursts reported just after the start of our observations by Effelsberg (ATel #16620).

Our Swift X-ray observations are part of a coordinated multiwavelength campaign of this FRB including optical observations (SiFAP2) and simultaneous radio observations by a network of european small dishes radiotelescopes (ATel #16565), the italian Northern Cross radio telescope in Medicina (ATels #16434, #16547) and the dishes in Medicina and Noto.

We observed the location of FRB20240114A daily from May 7th to May 14th, 2024 in the following time intervals:  
May 7th, within 05:00 - 05:15 UT, for 864 s of effective exposure; 
May 8th, within 04:52 - 05:11 UT, for 1132 s of effective exposure; 
May 9th, within 04:36 - 04:52 UT, for 956 s of effective exposure; 
May 10th, within 04:20 - 04:38 UT, for 1052 s of effective exposure; 
May 11th, within 03:53 - 04:08 UT, for 875 s of effective exposure; 
May 12th, within 03:36 - 05:33 UT, for 1053 s of effective exposure; 
May 13rd, within 05:03 - 05:17 UT, for 830 s of effective exposure; 
May 14th, within 03:08 - 04:54 UT, for 1166 s of effective exposure;

We obtained XRT data in Windowed Timing (WT) mode: a preliminary analysis indicates that no uncatalogued X-ray source compatible with the FRB position was detected in all observations. For the Galactic HI column density value in the source direction (n_H = 4.98 x 1020 cm-2, Kalberla et al. 2005, A&A, 440, 775) and assuming a single power-law spectrum of photon index 2, we obtain the following 3-sigma flux upper limits (ULs) in the range 0.3-10 keV:

4.8 x 10-13 erg/cm2/s for the first observation on May 7th; 
6.5 x 10-13 erg/cm2/s for the observations on May 8th;  
7.6 x 10-13 erg/cm2/s for the observations on May 9th;  
1.1 x 10-12 erg/cm2/s for the observations on May 10th; 
6.6 x 10-13 erg/cm2/s for the observations on May 11th; 
5.3 x 10-13 erg/cm2/s for the observations on May 12th; 
7.0 x 10-13 erg/cm2/s for the observations on May 13rd; 
6.6 x 10-13 erg/cm2/s for the observations on May 14th.

UVOT data where acquired in imaging, ""filter of the day"" mode, with exposures similar to the XRT ones. No detection on the full exposure images were obtained, and the following flux UL all for M2 filter were estimated:

6.5 x 10-14 erg/cm^2/s for May 7th; 
5.7 x 10-14 erg/cm^2/s for May 8th; 
6.5 x 10-14 erg/cm^2/s for May 9th; 
6.5 x 10-14 erg/cm^2/s for May 10th; 
9.3 x 10-14 erg/cm^2/s for May 11th; 
6.5 x 10-14 erg/cm^2/s for May 12th; 
7.7 x 10-14 erg/cm^2/s for May 13th; 
6.0 x 10-14 erg/cm^2/s for May 14th;

Moreover, we checked carefully XRT data at the times of 7 of the 32 bursts reported by Effelsberg (private communication), detected on May 9th and covered by the XRT exposure. No X-ray emission was detected within 10 ms around each trigger time. Further observations with Swift will follow.

We encourage multifrequency observations of FRB20240114A. The Swift mission is part of NASA's medium explorer (MIDEX) program, led by NASA with participation of Italy and the UK. We thank the Swift Team for making these observations possible, in particular B. Cenko and J. DeLaunay (Swift Observatory Duty Scientist)."

We report the following classifications of optical transients from spectroscopic observations with the Kast spectrograph on the Shane telescope. The targets were supplied by the Young Supernova Experiment and ZTF. All observations were made on 2024 June 05 UT. Classifications were performed with SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024).

Notes: 
When the redshift is given to 2 decimal places, it is derived from the SN spectrum.  Otherwise, the redshift is determined from the host galaxy. 
 
(1) We measure a Si 6355 velocity of -15,600 km/s. 
(2) The Si is relatively weak. We measure the Si 6355 velocity as -13,400 km/s. 
(3) The spectrum displays a strong change in spectral slope at ~5500 A. It appears blue on the redward side of this wavelength and red on the blueward side.  There is strong Ti II absorption consistent with a cool photosphere.  There are several relatively narrow spectral features with FWHM < 5000 km/s, indicating a low photospheric velocity.  The SN is located 12.8 arcmin from the center of M49, corresponding to 62.2 kpc in projection.  Assuming the SN is associated with M49, and thus having a redshift of 0.003, we measure a Ca II NIR triplet velocity of -15,600 km/s, significantly larger than expected from the narrow lines.  The O I 7774 feature has two minima, corresponding to -9300 and -14,000 km/s, respectively.  The spectrum is broadly similar to peculiar thermonuclear SNe PTF09dav (Sullivan et al., 2011, 732, 118) and SN 2016hnk (Galbany et al., 2019, A&A, 630, 76; Jacobson-Galan et al., 2020, ApJ, 896, 165).  The SN is currently at m ~ 16.5 mag and rising.  At the distance of M49, it is currently at M = -15.2 mag. 
(4) The spectrum has a blue, hot continuum consistent with a young core-collapse supernova. There is faint, narrow H-alpha at the host redshift."

The repeating fast radio burst FRB 20240114A (ATel #16420) has shown extreme radio burst activity since its discovery (ATel #16432; #16505; #16565; #16620). We had performed a search for gamma-ray emission potentially associated with the active repeating FRB with the Fermi LAT data at the precise position determined with the EVN (Atel #16542). Two episodes of enhanced gamma-ray emission have been identified  in MJD 60330 - 60340 and MJD 60370 - 60385 (ATel #16594).

We have performed the same analysis with recent Fermi LAT data. In the 5-day averaged light curves extracted from photons (> 100 MeV) in a sky region centered at the FRB position with the contaminant angle of the LAT Point Spread Function (PSF), we have identified an additional episode of enhanced gamma-ray emission during the period MJD 60425 - 60430 (2024 April 25 - 30). The gamma-ray flux reached a similar flux level as in the previous active episodes. This confirms the variable nature of the underlying gamma-ray source.

To investigate sources responsible for the enhanced gamma-ray emission, we generated the 0.1 - 500 GeV Fermi LAT TS map during this episode. Although the TS values are not significant, the TS map helped us identify sources of gamma-ray emission in the FRB field of view and possibly make flux comparisons. We found two nearby Fermi catalog sources 4FGL J2136.2 + 0032 (more than 4 degrees away from the FRB) and 4FGL J2122.5+0345 (second nearest to the FRB, less than about two degrees away from the FRB) as well as a likely new gamma-ray component centered at the coordinates RA = 321.962 degrees and DEC = 4.13973 degrees with a 1 sigma radius of 0.5 degrees, which is consistent with the FRB position.  The contribution from the Fermi catalog source 4FGL J2123.6+0535, which is the nearest to the FRB, is insignificant. The gamma-ray flux at the FRB position is estimated as 6.1E-8 photons/cm^2/s with the likelihood method.

We also found a gamma-ray flare in the form of triplets during an interval of only 15.7 seconds. The leading photon has an energy of 1.01 GeV, which arrived at MJD 60429.8434228366 with recorded coordinates of RA = 322.2002 degrees and DEC = 4.212177 degrees. We further extract photon series in a sky region centered at a specific position which has equal angular distance, d, to the two nearest Fermi catalog sources 4FGL J2123.6+0535 and 4FGL J2122.5+0345 and to FRB 20240114A, to avoid photon selection bias, with a radius of the energy dependent PSF plus d. We identified a fourth photon at 138 MeV which arrived in the triplet interval, at about 6 degrees away from the FRB position. The quadruplets show a GeV photon lead, with the relative time stamps of 0.0, 10.7, 11.6, 15.7 seconds and photon energies of 1.01 GeV, 138 MeV, 116 MeV and 141 MeV, respectively. The quadruplets correspond to a significant 15-second timing signal, as the daily averaged photon count is around 30 per day with typical daily exposure times of a few hours. Since the PSF of the LAT for photons at 1 GeV has a much smaller size than those 100 - 200 MeV photons, the GeV photon dominates the estimates of the position of the flare. We found the position of the GeV photon is much closer to the FRB, in favor of an association of the gamma-ray flare with FRB20240114A.

We encourage archival analysis of multi-wavelength observations during the episodes and the flare, and the continuation of monitoring observations of the FRB. The Fermi LAT 5-day averaged light curve, the TS map, and the position of the GeV photon are shown below (http://202.127.29.4/wenfei/ATEL_FRB20240114A_LAT_2nd.html).

MAXI team reported a possible GRB afterglow, GRB 240514E (GCN 36485). 
It is not confirmed yet, as Swift cannot follow-up this region for a week.  
We report here that there is a flare star system BD-21 1074 in the MAXI error box. 
It is also an X-ray source 1RXS J050649.5-213505 in the ROSAT catalog  
(0.8e-11 erg/s/cm2 in 0.1-2.4 keV) in Hunsch et al. 1999 (A&AS 135, 319). 
Because the nearby stars above this ROSAT flux level are about 90 stars scattering 
all over the sky,  
the chance coincidence of a GRB and a flare star is rare. 
There is no counterpart in the 3MAXI 7-year catalog with the sensitivity of 0.6e-11 erg/s/cm2 in 4-10 keV. 
If it was a flare from BD-21 1074, it would be the first detection with MAXI, 
and also the first detection of X-ray flare from BD-21 1074. 
 
BD-21 1074ABC are dMe stars triplet at the distance of 19.8 pc (Gaia DR3). 
Optical flares were reported in Messina et al. 2014 (A&A 570, 19).  
The observational results with MAXI are consistent with a stellar flare, i.e.  
soft X-ray spectrum, no variability during the scan, 
no detection in the previous scan at 92 min before, 
and no detection in the next scan at 19 h later. 
The measured X-ray luminosity was 1.0e32 erg/s, 
which is the highest class of flares as a dMe star.  
 
Since BD-21 1074 might be in an active phase, 
optical spectroscopic observations are recommended."

FRB20240114A is an actively repeating Fast Radio Burst first detected by the CHIME/FRB Collaboration (ATel #16420) on 14th January 2024. After its first detection, the source was observed by multiple telescope facilities and was predominantly seen to be active at L-band and lower radio frequencies (e.g. ATel #16430, #16432, #16452) . Recently, the source has been observed above 2GHz by the Nancay Radio Telescope (ATel #16597) and the Allen Telescope Array (ATel #16599) hinting at an increase in activity of this source towards higher radio frequencies.

Encouraged by this, we conducted wide-band observations with the Effelsberg 100-m Telescope for a total on-source time of 4 hours on 9th May 2024 using the newly installed, re-designed Ultra Broadband Receiver (UBB). The UBB covers a frequency range of 1.3 GHz - 6 GHz divided into 5 frequency bands (Band1: 1.3 - 1.95 GHz; Band2: 1.95 - 2.6 GHz; Band3: 3 - 4.12 GHz; Band4: 4.12 - 5.2 GHz; and Band5: 5.2 - 6 GHz). Five full Stokes, search mode filterbank files, one for each frequency band, were recorded with coherent de-dispersion at DM = 527.7 pc/cc applied to each frequency channel. These data were searched for bursts using the single pulse search pipeline `TransientX' (Yunpeng Men & Ewan Barr 2024) with a S/N threshold of 7.

We detected 32 unique bursts across the entire observing bandwidth. The following number of bursts had emission confined exclusively to their respective bands: 7 in Band1, 14 in Band2, and 3 in Band3. Additionally, the following bursts had emission spanning adjacent bands: 3 in Band1+Band2, 1 in Band2+Band3, and 1 in Band4+Band5. Furthermore, the Band4+Band5 burst shows broadband emission possibly going beyond our band edge of 6GHz (see plot in link below), and no emission is seen in Bands 1-3.  The frequency structure observed in the bursts is consistent with the NE2001 prediction for scintillation caused by a scattering screen in the Milky Way. We encourage further high frequency follow-up of this source given its high activity rate above 1.4 GHz.

A link to the dynamic spectra of the brightest burst detections from each band is given below.

We would like to thank Dr. Alex Kraus for scheduling time on the Effelsberg 100-m Telescope, as well as the telescope operating staff for smooth conduction of the observation.

Following up on earlier non-detections of the Type II SN 2024ggi in NGC 3621 (ATel #16612) at 1-26 GHz, we re-observed the source with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at 9.0 and 5.5 GHz on 2024 May 4.4-4.6 UT.

We report a redshift estimate for the host galaxy of the hyperactive fast radio burst (FRB) 20240114A, discovered and first reported by the CHIME/FRB collaboration on January 26, 2024 (ATel #16420). The host galaxy of the FRB, SDSS J212739.84+041945.8, was confidently identified and associated by the MeerTRAP team (ATel #16446) utilizing arcsecond localization precision with MeerKAT. This association was independently verified by the EVN-PRECISE team, who localized the FRB with a conservative precision of +/-200 milliarcseconds to the same SDSS galaxy (ATel #16542). 
 
 
 
Observations of the FRB host galaxy were conducted with the Optical System for Imaging and low-Intermediate-Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy (OSIRIS) spectrograph at the GTC telescope, situated at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on La Palma Island, Canary Islands, Spain, on May 1, 2024 UT. In the 1800s exposure of the host galaxy, various emission lines ([OII], H-beta, [OIII], [N II], H-alpha, and [S II]) were detected at a common redshift of z=0.1300+/-0002. This redshift is consistent (within 1-sigma) with photometric redshift reported in the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey DR8 (z = 0.269 +/- 0.139; [1]). Thus, we consider this to be the redshift of the FRB20201124A host. 
 
 
 
Based on our preliminary analysis, we classify the FRB host as a dwarf star-forming galaxy (absolute r-band magnitude = -17.46 +/- 0.01 AB). Moreover, we find that the dispersion measure (DM) contribution of the FRB host could be significant (~ 330 pc/cm^3). However, the FRB sightline intersects several candidate optical/infrared detected clusters and galaxy groups ([2,3,4,5,6,7]), which could also contribute considerably to the FRB DM. 
 
 
 
Furthermore, given the similarity between the FRB 20240114A host and the hosts of two active repeating sources also localized to star-forming dwarf galaxies (FRBs 20121102A and 20190520B [8,9]), we conducted a search for a similar potential persistent radio source (PRS) counterpart in archival radio survey data (TGSS [10], RACS[11], NVSS[12], FIRST[13], VLASS[14]) but found none. The most stringent 3-sigma upper limit on the PRS is 0.30 mJy at 1.5 GHz using FIRST survey data [13], translating to a luminosity upper limit of 6.9 x 10^37 erg/s at 1.5 GHz. This is at least 4 times fainter than the PRS detected spatially coincident with FRBs 20121102A and 20190520B [8,9]. We recommend searching for a fainter radio continuum counterpart at the location of the FRB source. 
 
 
 
Finally, we express gratitude to the GTC telescope staff for scheduling and executing these observations.

We have searched data collected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) from January to March 2024,  
for possible high-energy (E > 100 MeV) gamma-ray emission in  
spatial/temporal coincidence with the repeating FRB 20240114A (ATel #16420) and  
its extreme radio burst activity (bright bursts - ATel #16432; burst storm - ATel #16505;  
more than a hundred bright bursts - ATel #16565, GCN 27388).

We performed a search for transient gamma-ray emission from  
the precise FRB position reported by the EVN (ATel #16542). 
We used different time windows (from tens of seconds up to few months)  
around all the events reported so far for the repeating FRB 20240114A.  
Contrary to what was reported in ATel #16594, we found no significance gamma-ray emission.

We also performed a triplet photons search (see [1, 2]) on the FRB direction and 
and found no significant triplet possibly associated with the FRB events. 
The most significant triplet shown has Delta_t=155.1 s with first photon arriving at MET=606946577.4949882.

Gamma-ray flux upper bounds between 100 MeV and 1 GeV for this search vary between 5e-6 and 8e-9 [ph/cm^2/s],  
for 100 seconds to monthly time scales.  The respective detection test statistic (TS) is <2.

We report an analysis of SN 2024ggi with all-sky survey data from the Large Area Telescope (LAT), on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The SN 2024ggi was initially reported by Tonry et al. (TNS Astronomical Transient Report No. 207398) in NGC 3621 on April 11 (T0 = 2024-04-11 03:22:35.616 UTC) and later classified as a Type II supernova (Zhai et al., TNS Classification Report No. 16878). Since then, it has been monitored at several wavelengths (e.g. ATels #16586, #16587, #16588, or AstroNotes 2024-102, 2024-105).

We searched for emission from a new gamma-ray transient source. Preliminary analysis indicates no significant (> 5 sigma) new excess emission (> 100 MeV) at the optical position of SN 2024ggi (TNS). Assuming a power-law spectrum (photon index = 2.0, fixed) for a point source at the SN 2024ggi nominal position, the flux upper limit (95% confidence) between 100 MeV and 500 GeV is < 1.5e-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 (< 2.1e-11 erg cm^-2 s^-1) for a 14-day integration time after its discovery (2024-04-11 03:22:35 to 2024-04-25 at 03:22:35 UTC). This corresponds to a luminosity limit of < 1.1e41 erg s^-1 for a distance of 6.6 Mpc. This limit is about one order of magnitude above the hard X-ray luminosity reported by NuSTAR at T0+2 days (ATel #16587). No signal with larger fluence is detected either on shorter time scales (from T0 to T0+1, T0+3, or T0+7 days),  or in a daily or weekly light curve.

Since Fermi normally operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular monitoring of this region will continue. For this source the Fermi-LAT contact person is Guillem Marti-Devesa (guillem.marti-devesa@ts.infn.it).

FRB 20240114A, a bright repeating fast radio burst, was initially reported by the CHIME/FRB collaboration (ATel #16420) on January 26th 2024. High fluence emission (> 10 Jy-ms) from this source have been reported by numerous radio telescopes; including peculiar heightened activity as observed by uGMRT (Panda et al. ATel #16494) and FAST (Zhang et al. ATel #16505) at 650 MHz and 1.25 GHz, respectively. Reports by Zhang et al. (ATel #16433) at FAST indicate that the bursts exhibit highly band-limited or narrowband emission characteristics, spanning less than ~100 MHz. Similar behavior has been reported by Kumar et al. (ATel #16452) at the uGMRT. Moreover, observations with the widest instantaneous bandwidth across 704 MHz to 4032 MHz with the Parkes/Murriyang (Hobbs et al. 2019) revealed that the bursts are also band-limited (Uttarkar et al. ATel #16430). Recently, Hewitt et al. (ATel #16597) announced first detection above 2 GHz using the Nancay Radio Telescope also reporting the band-limited nature of these bursts.

In this report, we confirm bursting behavior above 2 GHz from this source, with the first wideband burst covering a large bandwidth of approximately 800 MHz, utilizing the recently upgraded Allen Telescope Array (ATA). We initiated our follow-up campaign less than 24 hours after the FRB 20240114A was announced by CHIME (ATel #16420). Since MJD 60336, we have actively monitored the source, accumulating close to 200 hours of observations. Observations initially targeted the coordinates provided by the initial CHIME localization (RA: 21h27m39.89s, DEC: +04d21m00.36s, ATel #16420), and subsequently, from MJD 60397 onwards, the updated coordinates from EVN (RA: 21h27m39.835s, Dec: +04d19m45.634s; ATel #16542) are being used. For these observations, 20 of the 42, 6.1-m dishes were configured to target two independent 672 MHz spectral bands, one centered at 1.23 GHz (L-band), and another at 1.9 GHz (S-band). We used similar data products and searched for bursts using the SPANDAK pipeline as highlighted by Sheikh et al. (2024) along with an additional machine learning-based sorting algorithm for candidate prioritization (Gajjar et al. 2022).

Our search targeted bursts with a fluence greater than 3.3 and 3.6 Jy-ms at L-band and S-band, respectively. We identified eight bursts, with five detected at L-band. Of the S-band bursts, two were exclusively visible only at S-band showing clear emission above 2 GHz, while one was simultaneously detected at both bands spanning total bandwidth of approximately 800 MHz (see attached plots). Estimated arrival times in the barycentric reference frame at infinite frequency for these bursts are given below. The fluences were calculated across the entire respective observing bandwidth (672 MHz) using the radiometer equation. The detection statistics may indicate relatively more activity at S-band with time.

Barycentric MJD | Fluence (full band) Jy-ms | Band

60393.7118702 | 14.72180 | L

60394.5833958 |18.43943 | L

60395.8475638 | 19.89944 | L

60396.7505371 | 38.28481, 109.63852 | L and S

60401.5914543 | 320.84970 | S

60416.7893764 | 12.29303 | L

Based on these detections, as well as reports from Hewitt et al. (ATel #16597), we speculate that the source is becoming increasingly active at higher radio frequencies and might display bursts over broader frequency ranges. Further observations and analysis of FRB 20240114A using the ATA are ongoing and we encourage further higher frequency follow-up.

We report on the detection of 5 repeat bursts from FRB 20240114A (ATel #16420) using the Nancay Radio Telescope (NRT) at a central frequency of 2.5 GHz. On 18 April 2024 we observed FRB 20240114A for an hour as part of the ECLAT (Extragalactic Coherent Light from Astrophysical Transients) campaign that monitors repeating fast radio bursts (Hewitt et al. 2023). We recorded full Stokes data with 512 MHz of bandwidth (2283-2795 MHz), and frequency and time resolution of 4 MHz and 16 microseconds, respectively (coherently dispersed to a DM of 527.7 pc/cm^3). We searched the data using a custom Heimdall-FETCH-based pipeline and detected 5 bursts above a detection S/N threshold of 7 (corresponding to a fluence threshold of about 0.18 Jy ms). The MJD times-of-arrival of the bursts at 2795 MHz (topocentric at NRT) are:60418.29815054 
60418.30476058 
60418.31231426 
60418.31687870 
60418.33012049 
 
The bursts are band-limited, showing spectral structure and emission extending well above 2500 MHz, making these the highest-frequency detections of FRB 20240114A bursts to date. Further analysis of these bursts is ongoing. 
 
ECLAT has been monitoring about a dozen repeating FRBs using the NRT since the beginning of 2022. We target sources for approximately an hour a week, mostly at a center frequency of 1.4 GHz. We are continuing to monitor FRB 20240114A and encourage further observations of FRB 20240114A at higher radio frequencies to ascertain whether the burst activity shows spectral evolution.

Following the reports on the multiwavelength emission from the supernova SN2024ggi (e.g., AstroNote 2024-100, Atel #16586, #16587, #16588), we searched the archival XMM-Newton observation obtained in 2017 (ObsID 0795660101) for X-ray emission from its progenitor at around the sky position of SN2024ggi (RA=11:18:22.091, Dec=-32:50:15.29). We made an X-ray image with a total effective exposure of 27 ks. There was no apparent X-ray source at the SN position within 4 arcsecs, the astrometric position accuracy of XMM-Newton EPIC (e.g., Pavan et al. AA 526,A122, 2011). A faint point-like X-ray source was detected by 9 arcsec apart from the SN position at RA=11:18:22 and Dec=-32:50:05, which is outside the astrometric accuracy of XMM-Newton. According to our spectroscopy around the SN position, the 0.3-10 keV flux of the progenitor is below the sensitivity limit of XMM-Newton EPIC (<2e-14 erg/s/cm2 for 30 ks; cf. XMM User's Handbook).

Following the recent reports of the discovery of the repeating FRB 20240114A (ATel #16420) and its extreme radio burst activity (bright bursts - ATel #16432; burst storm - Atel #16505; more than a hundred bright bursts - Atel #16565), we performed a search for gamma-ray emission potentially associated with the central engine activities and the bursting activities of the repeater with Fermi LAT at the precise position reported by the recent burst localization with the EVN (Atel #16542), which followed the MeerKAT's initial burst localization to the 1.5 arcsec level (Atel #16446).

We performed an aperture photometry analysis of the public Fermi LAT data. In the 5-day averaged LAT light curves extracted from photons (> 100 MeV) in a sky region centered at the source with the contaminant angle of the LAT point spread function (circular regions with a typical radius of 5.3 degrees or less, depending on photon energies), we found two episodes of enhanced gamma-ray emission in the direction of the FRB source during MJD 60330 - 60340 (2024 Jan 21 - Jan 30) and MJD 60370 - 60385 (2024 March 1 - March 15), which are coincident with the enhanced bursting activities (Atel #16420, 16430, 16433) and the hyper-active burst storms (burst rate increased to ~ 500 per hour, Atel #16505). The 5-day averaged gamma-ray flux level derived by the aperture photometry analysis during the first episode (a 10 day window) had never been reached in the previous year as seen in the Fermi LAT light curve, suggesting a chance possibility of about 0.02% or better for the occurrence of the first episode alone.

There are known Fermi catalog sources nearby: one source within 1 degree, two other sources within 2 degrees, and even six other sources 4-5 degrees away. Based on a customized selection of photons in the two time windows, we further obtained an estimate of the position of the potential variable source responsible for the flux variation, which is in favor of an association with FRB 20240114A rather than an association with those nearby sources. We also noticed that only a few GeV photons have been detected by Fermi/LAT in the data we analyzed. We encourage further multi-wavelength monitoring of the source and the search for similar signatures of variations on these time scales in addition to radio burst detections.

The Fermi LAT light curves are shown here (http://202.127.29.4/wenfei/ATEL_FRB20240114A_LAT.html).

The observation information and detection results are listed as below:

Obs. No. | Start Time | Exp.(ks) | Flux@0.5-2 keV (erg/s/cm2) | Flux@2-10 keV (erg/s/cm2) | SNR

The flux is obtained by assuming an absorbed power-law spectrum with N_H=3E23cm^-2 and photon index of 1.4 inferred from the NuSTAR observation (ATEL #16587). In the first observation, EP did not detect X-ray emission associated with SN 2025ggi and the upper limit is given above.

We started observations of the very young and nearby type-II SN2024ggi (TNS Astronomical Transient Report No. 207398 and TNS Classification Report No. 16878) with NuSTAR on 2024-04-13, 07:06:09 UT, which is around 2 days post discovery (PI Margutti). Using the first 18.2 ks of NuSTAR observations we find clear evidence for hard-X-ray emission at the location of the supernova with statistical significance > 10 sigma in each of the two NuSTAR modules. A preliminary spectral analysis shows that the data can be modeled with an absorbed power-law spectrum with photon index Gamma ~1.4 +\- 0.2 and intrinsic NH<3e23 cm-2 in the energy range 3-40 keV. The inferred absorbed flux is ~3.e-12 erg/s/cm2 in the 3-80 keV energy range, corresponding to a luminosity of ~2e40 erg/s at the distance of 6.6 Mpc, which is similar to SN2023ixf at a few days post explosion (Grefenstette 2023). The hard photon index is suggestive of an intrinsic thermal bremsstrahlung spectrum. Assuming a thermal bremsstrahlung spectral model we infer T> 40 keV.  Hot bremsstrahlung emission is expected to originate from the SN shock interaction with a dense medium (as was previously found for SNe 2014C and 2023ixf; Margutti et al., 2017; Brethauer et al., 2022; Grefenstette et al., 2023.)."

We report the detection of X-ray emission from the supernova SN2024ggi with the Mikhail Pavlinsky ART-XC telescope on board the SRG observatory. 
 
The supernova SN2024ggi was discovered with the ATLAS instrument (J. Tonry et al., 2024TNSTR1020....1T) on April 11, 2024 and classified as a Type II event (Qian Zha et al., 2024TNSCR1031....1Z) in the nearby galaxy NGC3621 (distance of 6.64 Mpc).  
 
Following these reports, the observational program of SRG/ART-XC was immediately changed and the position of SN2024ggi was observed from April 12, 2024 23:06 until April 13, 2024 14:27 (UTC), with a total exposure of ~55 ks.  
 
The ART-XC telescope confidently detects a point source at the location of SN2024ggi with the fluxes of (3.0+/-0.3)e-13  and  (1.9+/-0.5)e-13 erg cm-2 s-1 in the 4-12 and 12-20 keV energy bands, respectively.

The observation began on 2024-04-07 13:40:01 UT, about 5 days after the first detection of AT2024fkm, with a total exposure time of about 20 ks. No X-ray source was detected associated with AT2024fkm. We set an upper limit to the X-ray flux as 6.2E-15 erg/s/cm^2 (90% C.L.) in the 0.5-2keV band, assuming an absorbed power-law spectral shape with a photon index of 2 and the Galactic absorption N_H of 1.16E20cm^-2 in the source direction.

We report on the independent detection of an X-ray source EP240327a by the Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) on board the Einstein Probe (EP) mission. The observation began at 2024-03-27T09:51:02 (UTC) with a total exposure time of 24011 seconds. The position of the source is R.A. = 203.853 deg, DEC = 7.488 deg (J2000) with an uncertainty of 3 arcmin (radius, 90% C.L. statistical and systematic). The averaged spectrum can be fitted by an absorbed blackbody model (tbabs*bbody) with NH fixed to the Galactic value of 2.7 x 10^20 cm^-2. The blackbody temperature is estimated to be 79(-15/+18) eV. The derived average unabsorbed flux in 0.5 - 4.0 keV is 3.5(-0.9/+0.9) x 10^-12 erg/s/cm^2.

The position of EP240327a is 1.7 arcmin away from the X-ray source reported by Hernandez-Garcia et al. (ATel #16576), suggesting EP240327a being consistent with this source within its positional error, which is found to be associated with the nucleus in the early-type galaxy SDSS J133519.91+072807.4 at a redshift of 0.0024.

The source was not detected, however, in a few of other WXT long-term observations. One of the observations started one day earlier, at 2024-03-26T20:51:07 (UTC) with a total exposure time of 23297 seconds, giving an upper limit of 2.4 x 10^-12 erg/s/cm^2 in 0.5 - 4.0 keV (3 sigma limit). The other observation with a relatively long exposure time of 42267 seconds started at 2024-03-30T06:52:37 (UTC), giving an upper limit of 1.8 x 10^-12 erg/s/cm^2 in 0.5 - 4.0 keV (3 sigma limit).

The above observation was made with the WXT instrument during the commissioning phase of EP.

We report the detection of an X-ray source in a Swift/XRT observation from February 4th 2024, at a distance of 6'' +/- 3''.6 from the nucleus of the galaxy SDSS J133519.91+072807.4 (redshift 0.024, classified spectroscopically as Starforming by the SDSS pipeline). A Chandra observation taken on April 3rd 2024 confirms a nuclear origin for the X-ray detection. 
 
 
 
SDSS J133519.91+072807.4 began showing significant nuclear variability in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; Bellm et al., 2019, PASP, 131, 018002) alert stream in December 2019 (as ZTF19acnskyy, RA = 13:35:19.936, DEC = +7:28:7.66). The ALeRCE broker (Forster et al., 2021, AJ, 161, 242) light curve classifier (Sanchez-Saez et al., 2021, AJ, 161, 141) classified it as an active galactic nucleus (AGN). 
 
 
 
Our group has been monitoring the source with Swift since 2021. No X-ray detections were obtained in the XRT observations of August 2021 (MJD 59381), July 2022 (MJD 59775), and July 2023 (MJD 60140). The Swift observation taken on February 4th 2024, showed X-ray emission in the 0.3-2 keV energy band at a distance of 6'' +/- 3''.6 from the nucleus of the galaxy. We modelled the spectrum with a black body model with kT =104 +/- 9 eV temperature and obtained a flux of 7.4x10^-12  erg/cm^2/s. Assuming the redshift of SDSS J133519.91+072807.4, a luminosity of 9.62x10^42 erg/s is estimated. 
 
 
 
After the first XRT detection, we requested new ToO observations with Swift. Five additional observations have been carried out, obtaining the following fluxes in the 0.3-2 keV energy band for the six available observations, assuming a black body model. Errors are given at a 68.00% confidence: 
 
 
 
 
2024-02-04 :  7.4[6.7 - 7.6]e-12 erg/cm^2/s  
2024-02-13 :  1.8[1.3 - 2.1]e-12 erg/cm^2/s  
2024-02-18 :  2.2[1.1 - 2.3]e-12 erg/cm^2/s  
2024-03-05 :  4.4[3.1 - 5.5]e-13 erg/cm^2/s  
2024-03-07 :  6.5[5.7 - 6.8]e-12 erg/cm^2/s  
2024-04-04 :  2.8[2.5 - 3.0]e-12 erg/cm^2/s  
 
To confirm the position of the X-ray emission, we requested a DDT observation with Chandra. The source was observed on April 3rd 2024, during 2 ksec. The image shows a source located at RA = 13:35:19.93 DEC = +7:28:07.48 , i.e., coincident with the nucleus of SDSS J133519.91+072807.4. 
 
 
 
We thank the Swift and Chandra teams for the rapid scheduling of ToO and DDT observations."

We report on our ongoing high-cadence monitoring campaign of the actively repeating fast radio burst source FRB 20240114 (ATel #16420). Since its discovery by CHIME/FRB in January 2024 (ATel #16420), we have been observing FRB 20240114 daily at P-band (0.33 GHz), L-band (1.4 GHz) and C-band (4.5 GHz) using a set of five small 25-32 meter European radio telescopes. The participating telescopes are the 25-m RT-1 Westerbork telescope (the Netherlands), the 25-m Stockert telescope (Germany), the 32-m Torun telescope (Poland), the 25-m Onsala O8 telescope (Sweden), and the 25-m Dwingeloo telescope (the Netherlands). Whenever possible, the telescopes observe simultaneously at complementary wavelengths. 
 
To date, we have accumulated over 1250 hours of exposure time between all five    telescopes, which reduces to 600 hours of unique on-source time when accounting for simultaneous observations. So far, we have detected 111 unique bursts, of which 34 were detected by multiple telescopes at the same time, though never at multiple frequency bands simultaneously. All bursts have a fluence higher than our completeness threshold of about 10 Jy ms and the brightest bursts have a fluence on the order of 1 kJy ms. Two bursts were detected at P-band: we previously reported one of these (ATel #16432) and the second is simultaneous with a burst reported by the Northern Cross telescope at slightly higher radio frequency (ATel #16547). The other 109 bursts are all detected at L-band; we have not detected bursts at C-band.  
 
Our campaign is still ongoing and we will continue to monitor the source for up to 11 hours per day, the full time it is above the local telescope horizons in Europe. We encourage simultaneous observations at other wavelengths, and we are open to collaborate on multi-wavelength studies by providing precise burst arrival times, fluences, and other information.

We report the detection of a bright radio burst from the repeating FRB 20240114A (ATel #16420) with the Northern Cross (NC) radio telescope. As in ATel #16434, observations were carried out with a 16 MHz bandwidth at a central frequency of 408 MHz, with a 14.468 kHz channel width and a 138.24 μs sampling time. We used 16 cylinders of the north-south arm of the NC, 26 minutes per day with similar starting times dictated by the transit of the source. The coordinates used for the observations were instead updated to R.A.: 21:27:39.84, Dec: +04:19:46.34 (J2000), following the source localisation (ATel #16446).The burst was detected on March 17th, 2024 at 08:56:40.894 UTC (MJD: 60386.3726955376, Barycentric Time of Arrival at 400 MHz). It presents multiple sub-burst components, with the main one (labelled as C1 in the attached Figure) having a FWHM duration of 1.8 ms and a fluence of 124.3 ± 1.5 Jy ms. The second component (C2) arrives 7.5 ms before C1, has a 1.9 ms duration, and a fluence of 24.6 ± 1.5 Jy ms. We also note a third, faint component (C3) arriving 3 ms after C1, with a duration of 1 ms.The search was performed using Heimdall (Barsdell et al. 2012) and FETCH (Agarwal et al. 2020) spanning a dispersion measure (DM) range between 400 pc cm-3 and 600 pc cm-3 with Signal to Noise Ratio > 7. The burst was then incoherently de-dispersed to a fit-optimized DM = 527.8 pc cm-3, consistent with previous burst detections from the same source and with our previous detection at 408 MHz (ATel #16434). We found no significant difference in DM between the various burst components.The link below shows the waterfall plot for this burst, with the labels for the different sub-burst components that we found highlighted on top of the de-dispersed time series. The monitoring of the source is still ongoing.

We observed the recently discovered FRB 20240114 (ATel #16420) with a sub-array of European Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) Network (EVN) dishes (EVN-Lite mode), as part of the PRECISE project. We had two observing runs, both of which were carried out at L-band (1254 - 1510 MHz). We recorded raw voltages as 2-bit samples, storing both left and right circular polarisations at all participating stations. The raw voltage data from the Effelsberg telescope (the most sensitive dish in the array) were transferred to Onsala Space Observatory, where they were processed to generate total intensity (Stokes I) filterbanks at a time and frequency resolution of 64 microseconds and 31.25 kHz, respectively. The data were then searched using the Heimdall software package, limiting the DM search range to 527.7 +/- 50 pc cm^-3. True astrophysical bursts were automatically distinguished from human-generated radio frequency interference using the ML-classifier FETCH (Agarwal et al. 2020).  
 
Epoch 1 (PRECISE code PR318A, EVN code EK056A) was conducted on Thursday 15 Feb 2024 (MJD  60355) from 06:41:35 UT until 12:00:00 UT with the following stations: Effelsberg (Germany), Torun (Poland), Onsala (Sweden), Westerbork (The Netherlands), Noto (Italy), Irbene (Latvia) and six e-MERLIN stations (all but the Lovell telescope, United Kingdom). The telescopes were pointed at the previously reported CHIME/FRB baseband position of this source (21h27m39.888s +04d21m00.36s, J2000, ATel #16420). During this run we detected seven bursts from FRB 20240114A.  
 
Epoch 2 (PR319A / EK056B) was conducted on Tuesday 20 Feb 2024 (MJD 60360) from 06:16:35 UT until 11:56:23 UT with the same stations as in Epoch 1, with the addition of the Tianma 65-metre Telescope (China). In this run the telescopes were pointed at RA = 21h27m39.8367, Dec = +04d19m46.2333s (J2000), which is a weighted average from the two quoted MeerKAT positions of this source (ATel #16446). During this run we detected 13 bursts from FRB 20240114A. 
 
We used phase-referencing, where the scans on FRB 20240114A are interleaved with phase-calibrator scans on J2125+0441. We obtained a total on-source observing time of 200 minutes (Epoch 1) and 202 minutes (Epoch 2) for FRB 20240114A. 
 
After the bursts were found in the Effelsberg data, the full set of raw voltage data from all individual stations were shipped to JIVE over the internet. The data from Epoch 1 were correlated with SFXC (Keimpema, 2015). The data reduction from Epoch 2 is still in progress.  
 
An initial, rough burst position was derived using a delay-mapping technique (see Marcote et al. 2020, for more details) on the brightest burst of Epoch 1. The delay-mapping position is RA = 21h27m39.9s, Dec = +04d19m43.4s (J2000) and has an estimated uncertainty of a few arcsec. The burst data (of the one bright burst that was used in the delay-mapping) was then re-correlated at the delay-mapping position. The data was then calibrated and imaged following standard procedures in CASA. From this we find a best position for the burst (J2000): 
 
RA = 21h27m39.835s  
Dec = +04d19m45.634s  
 
Since this position is derived from a preliminary analysis of a single burst there is some ambiguity in the burst position due to sidelobe structure. We thus quote a conservative uncertainty on this position of +/-200 milliarcseconds (see plot below). A careful analysis of all burst data is expected to robustly provide a positional uncertainty on the order of milliarcseconds. 
 
Our EVN-PRECISE position is well within the 1-sigma confidence interval of the MeerKAT position(s), which have an uncertainty of ~1.5 arcseconds (ATel #16446).

We report the detection of a burst storm from the repeating FRB 20240114A, during a 30-minute observation by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) between UTC2024-03-05 04:31:00 and UTC2024-03-05 05:01:00, implying the burst rate of ~500/h with fluence threshold of 0.015 Jy ms. The burst rate increased by a factor of 14 from our previous observation on 2024-02-25. 
 
Following the discovery of FRB 20240114A by CHIME/FRB (ATel #16420), the FAST FRB key science project team monitored the source using the position obtained by MeerKAT (ATel #16446) on a weekly cadence. Our observation was taken with a sampling time of 98.304 microsecond for 8192 frequency channels in the FAST observing band of 1.0-1.5 GHz. In light of the source's hyper-activity, we encourage multi-wavelength follow-ups."

We report Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) observations of the tidal disruption event ASASSN-15oi taken as part of the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS; McConnell et al. 2020, PASA, 37, e048) and Variable And Slow Transients Survey (VAST; Murphy et al. 2021, PASA, 38, e054) at 887.5 MHz. ASASSN-15oi was radio quiet for 6 months after the initial disruption, until a radio flare on November 12, 2015 was reported by Horesh et al. (2021 Nature Astronomy, 5, 491) that decayed over an year. They also reported a late time re-brightening (4 years after the disruption) in data from the VLA Sky Survey (Lacy et al. 2020, PASP, 132, 035001).

We observed the field of ASASSN-15oi with a cadence of roughly every two months since mid 2023 as part of VAST, with additional observations as part of RACS. The source was clearly detected in all epochs of RACS and VAST data, which confirms the 4-year old radio rebrightening of this source which started in 2019 but then began to decline in the VAST observations starting in June 2023.

Recently, though, this source showed a sudden dip in the flux density by almost a factor of 2 around October 2023. Subsequent observations showed a rise back to the previous level and then (in February 2024) another decline (see the table below and the figure attached).  Observations of several other sources in the field showed no such variations.

Flux density measurements for the latest VAST observations of the source are given below.

We report the detection of 51 bursts from the repeating FRB 20240114A, observed using the uGMRTâs Band 4 (550 to 750 MHz) receivers on 25th February 2024 between 03:11:22 and 10:49:24 UTC above 10-sigma significance. We followed up on this FRB after its detection was reported by the CHIME/FRB Collaboration (ATel #16420), and its subsequent localisation by MeerKAT (ATel #16446). We observed the FRB using a phased array (PA) beam of the uGMRT formed towards the position given in ATel #16446. This study follows the detection of 10 bursts with the uGMRT reported in ATel #16452 prior to the localisation. The 51 bursts reported in this ATel have fluences ranging from 0.6 to 27.8 Jy ms, dispersion measures (DMs) ranging from 527.1 to 530.3 pc cm^-3, and intrinsic widths ranging from 0.7 to 12.3 ms, illustrating a highly variable burst morphology for this repeater. The burst rate observed at the GMRT is about 8 per hour above a fluence of 0.6 Jy ms. Some of the bursts are significantly scattered with a time scale of up to 4.7 ms. We also report the detection of rich temporal structure from FRB 20240114A, using coherently dedispersed data at 40.96 micro-seconds, which probed sub-burst time scale up to 100s of micro-second (see Dynamic spectra of two bright bursts). Band-limited emissions of 55 MHz (median value) are seen from this repeater.   
 
We would like to thank the Director and the operations group of the observatory for the prompt time allocation and scheduling of our observation. The GMRT is run by the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics, of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.

Following the discovery of FRB20240216A reported by the ASKAP/CRAFT collaboration (ATEL #16468) the FAST FRB key science project team observed the position given in the ATel: RA: 10:12:19.9 DEC: +14:02:26 for one hour using the center beam of the 19-beam L-band receiver onboard the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Our observation was taken between UTC2024-02-22 17:22:00 and UTC2024-02-22 18:22:00 with a ROACH2-based backend with 49.152 us time resolution and a 0.122 MHz channelization in the 1.05-1.45GHz band. We detected no radio burst with dispersion 
measure between 305 and 315 pc cm^{-3} and with S/N above seven sigma, equivalent to about 69 mJy ms fluence limit for a fiducial pulse of width 50 ms (Lin L. et al. 2020 Nature). This result could indicate that either 1. the source activity may have varied since its detection on 2024-02-16; 2. the L-band emission is much weaker; or 3. the position of the source may be outside of the 3 arcminute diameter 
FAST center beam. 
 
We plan to take more observations toward the direction of the source and encourage follow-up observations and precise localization of the repeating FRB.

Our team has followed up on EP's initial X-ray flare detection (EPW20240219aa; ATel 16463; ATel 16472) and discovered a weak, untriggered gamma-ray transient in the Fermi/GBM data at 2024-02-19T06:21:42 UTC. This transient lasted approximately 50 seconds and its location aligns with that of EPW20240219aa.  
 
Considering the factors that the gamma-ray transient is consistent with EPW20240219aa in terms of event time, duration, and location, we are inclined to believe that this is a GRB event. A preliminary spectral analysis indicates that its peak energy reaches a few hundred keV, which further supports its classification as a GRB. 
 
We strongly recommend further follow-up on EPW20240219aa to confirm its physical nature and to detect any afterglows."

We report the discovery of a repeating fast radio burst source FRB20240216A detected by the Australian SKA Pathfinder. The FRB source was detected with the recently commissioned CRAFT coherent (CRACO) image-plane fast transient detector. Two bursts were detected with a signal to noise ratio greater than 9, and burst widths of 41 and 55 ms. Three further bursts below the search threshold were identified on further inspection of the data.

The bursts were detected at the position (J2000) of RA: 10:12:19.9 DEC: +14:02:26. The position uncertainty is approximately 30 arcsec in both right ascension and declination. A refined position will be possible after additional post processing.

The arrival times (UTC, topocentric, at a reference frequency of 800 MHz) of the bursts and their signal to noise ratios are 
2024-02-16 17:41:56.32  S/N: 6 
 2024-02-16 17:42:02.91  S/N: 8 
 2024-02-16 17:42:14.15  S/N: 17 
 2024-02-16 17:42:22.65  S/N: 20 
2024-02-16 17:42:49.50  S/N:  7

The signal to noise ratios reported above were estimated from a tied array filterbank at the position of the burst source. The signal to noise ratios reported by the search pipeline for the two bursts it detected (the third and fourth bursts listed above) are 11 and 13, respectively.

The bursts were reported at a dispersion measure of 310 pc cm^-3. This is well in excess of the Galactic contribution, predicted to be 37 pc cm^-3 from the NE2001 model (Cordes & Lazio 2001, arXiv:0207156) and 28 pc cm^-3 from the YMW16 model (Yao et al,. 2017, ApJ, 835, 29).

The field the source was detected in has been observed by ASKAP/CRACO regularly during February 2024, with a total integration time of 13 hours since 2024-02-01. No other bursts with a signal to noise ratio in excess of 9 have been detected from the source in those observations.

The bursts were detected in offline image-plane searches of visibilities recorded from the central 24 antennas of the array. The visibilities were recorded with 13.8 ms temporal resolution, at a central frequency of 943 MHz with a total bandwidth of 288 MHz and a spectral resolution of 1 MHz.

We encourage follow up of the source.

We report detection of 10 bursts from the repeating FRB 20240114A using the uGMRT observations at band-3 (300 - 500 MHz), band-4 (550 - 750 MHz), and band-5 (1060 - 1460 MHz). We followed up on this source after the CHIME/FRB collaboration reported on this active repeating FRB 20240114A (ATel #16420). We observed using the band-4 (550-750 MHz) of uGMRT on February 1, 2024, with an on-source time of 114 minutes. We detected five bursts in total using an incoherent array (IA) beam, from a search in the DM range of 520 to 535 pc/cc. A simultaneously recorded phased-array (PA) beam using the central square GMRT dishes did not result in any detection, indicating that the actual source is at least an arcminute away from the best-fit localization position given in ATel #16420. This deduction is consistent with the recent localization using the MeerKAT telescope (ATel #16446). 
 
We also observed the source in the 300-500 MHz (band-3) frequency range for 104 minutes on February 8, 2024, and 71 minutes on February 12, 2024. We detected 5 bursts with the PA beam. We also observed at band-5 (1060-1460 MHz) on February 13, 2024, with an on-source time of 65 minutes, but we did not detect any burst in this observation above a peak flux density of 0.7 Jy (above a threshold of 8 sigma, for a pulse-width of 2 ms). 
 
The fluence of all the detected bursts is calculated using the radiometer equation and the system equivalent flux density (SEFD) of the telescope at the respective bands. With the localization provided by ATel #16446, we use the scaling factor for correcting the fluences for the bursts detected in the band-3 PA beam, based on the offset from the pointing centre. The fluence of the bursts detected in band-4 are in the range 1.4 - 3.1 Jy ms, while the corresponding range for the bursts detected in band-3 is 2 - 10.1 Jy ms. The median width of the bursts detected in band-3 and band-4 are nearly 10 and 5 ms, respectively. All the bursts show narrow-band emission behaviour, with the observed emission bandwidths comparable to or smaller than 100 MHz, similar to what has been reported for earlier detection of bursts from this source (ATel #16420, ATel #16433). 
 
We also provide a 5 sigma upper limit of 140 micro Jy on the flux density of any continuous emission, from the host galaxy or a persistent radio source, if any, associated with FRB 20240114A, at 650 MHz (band-4).

We report the localisation of the repeating FRB 20240114A using two bursts detected with MeerKAT. 
We carried out a 1h L-band observation of FRB&nbsp20240114A on 9 February 2024 at 08:41 UT in the 
frequency range between 856-1712 MHz as part of a Director's Discretionary Time Proposal (proposal 
id: DDT-20240206-JT-01), following reports of its possible hyper-activity by the CHIME/FRB (ATel 
#16420), Parkes (ATel #16430) and FAST (ATel #16433) telescopes.

When triggered, MeerTRAP can capture channelised voltage data from the individual MeerKAT antennas, which can be used for localisation in the image domain using our transient buffer imaging pipeline (Rajwade et al. in prep; also see Rajwade et al. 2020, Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers Conference Series Vol. 11447, Ground-based and Airborne Instrumentation for Astronomy VIII. p. 114470J). We used the transient buffer data from the two brightest bursts, detected S/N of 19.47 and 49.22 respectively, to localise FRB 20240114A. The S/N maximising DM of these two bursts is 529.31 pc cm^-3 and 531.26&nbsppc&nbspcm^-3.

The two bursts were localised to the following best-fit positions (epoch J2000): 
RA: 21:27:39.83 
Dec: +04:19:46.02 
MJD (topocentric, at the top of the MeerKAT L-band): 60349.36998543 
and 
RA: 21:27:39.84 
Dec: +04:19:46.34 
MJD (topocentric, at the top of the MeerKAT L-band): 60349.37061473

The total uncertainty in the burst position is composed of two components, a statistical component from source fitting in the FRB image and a systematic component from the astrometric correction. We used the Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey (RACS) catalogue (McConnell et al. 2020, PASA, 37, e048) as 
the reference frame to correct the astrometry in the MeerKAT images. The total uncertainty is currently ~1.5 arcsec with the astrometric uncertainty being dominant. Improvements may be possible with more bursts and deeper images of the field. The localisation of the FRB&nbsp20240114A source can be seen in the link below.

The two bursts are spatially coincident with J212739.84+041945.8, a galaxy cataloged in the Sloan 
Digital Sky Survey with a photometric redshift of z&nbsp=&nbsp0.42 (Alam et al. 2015, ApJS, 219, 12). Using the Probabilistic Association of Transients to their Hosts (PATH, Aggarwal et al. 2021, ApJ, 911, 95) software, we found the association probability with this galaxy to be 0.9974, assuming the prior on an unseen host of 0.2. This redshift, if confirmed, lies in the range of the highest redshift cluster of galaxies identified in ATel #16426. FRB 20240114A is still active and we encourage continued radio observations of the source and multi-wavelength follow-up of its host galaxy.

We would like to thank the Director and the operators of MeerKAT and the South African Radio 
Astronomy Observatory (SARAO) for the prompt scheduling of the observation. The MeerKAT telescope is operated by SARAO, which is a facility of the National Research Foundation, an agency of the Department of Science and Innovation.

The first window covers the time range between T0 - 8.5 days and T0, with T0 being the earliest optical detection time as reported by GOTO (2024-01-20 13:18:42.6 to 2024-01-29 01:18:42.6), during which time IceCube was recording good quality data. In this case, we report a p-value of 1.0, consistent with background expectation. We accordingly derive a time-integrated muon-neutrino flux upper limit for this source of E^2 dN/dE = 6.9 x 10^-2 GeV cm^-2 at 90% CL, under the assumption of an E^-2 power law. 90% of events IceCube would detect from a source at this declination with an E^-2 spectrum have energies in the approximate energy range between 600 GeV and 220 TeV. 
 
The second search was performed in a time range of T0 to T0 + 2 weeks (2024-01-29 01:18:42.6 to 2024-02-12 01:18:42.6), during which time IceCube was recording good quality data. In this case, we report a p-value of 0.13, also consistent with background expectation. We accordingly derive a time-integrated muon-neutrino flux upper limit for this source of E^2 dN/ dE = 7.6 x 10^-2 GeV cm^-2 at 90% CL, under the assumption of an E^-2 power law.

We report the detection of a radio burst from the newly discovered repeater FRB 20240114A (ATel #16420) with the Northern Cross (NC) radio telescope. Observations were carried out with a 16 MHz bandwidth at a central frequency of 408 MHz, with a 14.468 kHz channel width and a 138.24 μs sampling time. We monitored FRB 20240114A for 7 days since February 28th 2024, using 16 cylinders of the North South arm of the NC, 26 mins per day with similar starting times dictated by the transit of the source. The coordinates used for the observations were RA: 321.9 deg, Dec: +4.35 deg (J2000), as in ATel #16420.

The burst was detected on February 1st 2024 at 11:49:06.081 UTC (MJD: 60341.4924314915, Barycentric Time of Arrival at 400 MHz) and has 35 ± 3 Jy ms fluence and a width of 4.6 ms. 
The search was performed using Heimdall (Barsdell et al. 2012) and FETCH (Agarwal et al. 2020) spanning a DM range between 400 and 600 cm-3 with Signal to Noise Ratio > 7. The best fit DM obtained for this candidate is 527.7 ± 0.8 pc cm-3, consistent with previous burst detections from the same source (ATel#16420, #16426, #16430, #16432. #16433). The link below shows the waterfall plot for this burst.

The monitoring of the source is still ongoing.

Following the detection of FRB 20240114A by CHIME/FRB (ATel#16420), we conducted a series of targeted observations on January 28, January 29, February 1, and February 4, 2024, using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Each session lasted 30 minutes, with the central beam of FAST's 19-beam L-band Array pointed to RA (J2000) 21h27m39.888s, +04d21m0.36s (ATel#16420), and the data stream was recorded with a sampling time of 49.152 microsecond for 4096 frequency channels. 
Here we report 38 bursts of FRB 20240114A detected during the observation series, implying an average burst rate of ~20/h, above the 0.015 Jy ms fluence threshold of FAST (Li et al., 2021). The brightest burst was observed at the topocentric burst arrival time of UTC 2024-01-29 05:13:01. Averaging over the entire FAST observing band of 1.0-1.5 GHz, we observed the brightest burst at a preliminary fluence of 156.8±1.9 mJy ms with an effective pulse width of 1.27 ms.  
The best Dispersion measure (DM) and rotation measure (RM) values of the brightest burst were consistent with previous observational results (ATel#16420&comma;  ATel#16430&comma; ATel#16432). 
We detected a ~ 96% degree of linear polarization and a ~ 25% degree of circular polarization in the burst. 
Except for a few bright events, the flux densities of the most bursts we detected were in the range of 10-30 mJy. We note that these bursts were primarily observed in the frequency range of 1.0-1.2 GHz, exhibiting band-limited emission (< 100 MHz) feature distinct from that reported from Parkes (ATel#16430). 
Given the low fluence and low frequency of the bursts from the FAST observations, we call for more follow-up monitoring efforts at a lower frequency band (≤ 1 GHz) to obtain a more comprehensive spectrum. We also encourage radio interferometric observations to localize FRB 20240114A further.

We report the detection of a bright radio burst originating from FRB 20240114A (ATel #16420) using the Westerbork RT1 25-m telescope. Observations were carried out at a central frequency of 327 MHz using a bandwidth of 54 MHz.  
 
 
The preliminary properties of the burst are: 
Arrival time (MJD, TDB): 60341.538079081   
Fluence: 224 +/- 45 Jy ms  
 
The arrival time is referenced to infinite frequency at the solar system barycentre (in TDB) using a dispersion measure (DM) of 527.7 pc cm^-3, as determined by CHIME/FRB in the discovery (ATel #16420), and a DM constant of 1/(2.41 x 10^-4) MHz^2 pc^-1 cm^3 s. Our burst is consistent with the DM reported by CHIME/FRB. The fluence is determined by averaging over the entire observing bandwidth and by applying the radiometer equation using a system equivalent flux density (SEFD) of 2100 Jy. We estimate a 20% error on the fluence which arises from the uncertainty on the SEFD of the telescope.  
 
Since its discovery, we have been monitoring the source using multiple 25-m and 32-m dishes in Europe - both at 327 MHz (P-band) and 1350 MHz (L-band) for up to 10 hours per day. Up until the burst detection we observed the source for 19 hours at P-band and 21 hours at L-band. The completeness threshold for 8-sigma detections corresponds to a fluence of 10 Jy ms and 80 Jy ms for L-band and P-band, respectively. Thus far we have not detected a burst at L-band. We note that this source is detectable at L-band, given the recent discovery of a multitude of bursts using the UWL receiver at the Parkes/Murriyang radio telescope (ATel #16430).  
 
The detection of a bright burst from FRB 20240114A after limited exposure could indicate that the source is still highly active. We therefore encourage follow-up observations at all wavelengths.

We report the detection of five repeat bursts from the FRB 20240114A source using the Parkes/Murriyang Ultra Wideband Low (UWL) receiver system (Hobbs et al. 2020). Following initial reports of its discovery and possible hyper-activity by CHIME/FRB (ATel #16420), we conducted a target-of-opportunity observation between 05:00 and 06:00 UTC on 2 Feb 2024. The search-mode data were recorded at 64 microsecond temporal resolution and 0.5 MHz wide channels covering 3328 MHz bandwidth, with full Stokes polarimetry. The data were searched for FRBs using a Heimdall-FETCH based multi-tiered sub-banded search pipeline to search for single pulses as described in Kumar et al. (2021).

The source appears to have been highly active, with five bursts detected throughout the observation window. The brightest burst had a detection signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of 72.7. None of the detected bursts show emission above 2 GHz. Preliminary polarimetric analysis of the data using the brute force method in the rmfit tool in the psrchive software package (Hotan et al. 2004) shows this burst to have a rotation measure (RM) of approximately +360 rad/m^2, consistent with the magnitude of the RM reported by ATel #16420.

We thank the Parkes System Scientist for the prompt scheduling of the observation.

We report on the alignment of the recently reported repeating FRB 20240114A (ATel #16420) with a galaxy cluster at ~425 Mpc. The CHIME FRB localization intersects multiple galaxy clusters [1,2] identified in DESI legacy imaging at redshifts z~0.09, 0.189, and 0.4. The lowest redshift cluster is centered at RA, DEC (J2000) = 321.9511 deg, +4.5185 deg with a physical size of R_200 = 1.2 Mpc, corresponding to angular size of ~12 arcmin. The brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) has a spectroscopic redshift of 0.0906 [1], and the total mass of the cluster is log(M_500/M_sun) ~ 14.3 [1]. The brightest galaxy within the CHIME FRB localization (ATel #16420) lies at RA, DEC (J2000) = 321.9203 deg, +4.3532 deg, corresponding to an offset of ~10 arcmin from the cluster center. This galaxy has a photometric redshift of z_phot = 0.098 +/- 0.019 [3] from the legacy survey DR9. This photometric redshift is consistent with the redshift of the BCG, and we suggest that it may be a cluster member. There are also two other likely cluster members within 2 arcmin of the CHIME localization at RA, DEC (J2000) = 321.8841 deg, +4.3422 deg, and RA, DEC (J2000) = 321.8954 deg, +4.3736 deg.

If associated with the FRB, this may provide an important probe of the both the intracluster medium and intergalactic medium contribution to the DM, which suggests a further distance than 425 Mpc. Even if associated with a more distant galaxy (or a member of the other clusters), the contribution of the low redshift cluster's halo to the DM must be taken into account.

Further radio observations to obtain a precise localization of the repeater are encouraged.

The CHIME/FRB Collaboration reports the discovery of a new repeating source of FRBs (FRB 20240114A). We detected one burst (real-time S/N ~8), and then after a week, observed two more bright bursts (real-time S/Ns 18 and 32) within four days of each other. Both bright detections were streamed through our VOEvents service. This source is especially interesting because it is at a declination ~4.4 degrees where CHIME's daily exposure (FWHM of the beams at 600 MHz) has a median of about 4 minutes (compared to a ""typical"" daily exposure of ~15 minutes near zenith, e.g., Fig. 5 in CHIME/FRB Collaboration ApJS 257 59), hinting at a high burst rate of the source above ~1 Jy ms fluence thresholds. 
 
From the real-time detection system, the events occurred at 2024-01-14 21:50:39, 2024-01-21 21:30:40, and 2024-01-24 21:20:11 UTC at 400 MHz (topocentric at CHIME near Penticton, Canada). Based on voltage data of the brightest burst, we obtain a brute-force DM of 527.7 pc cm^-3 (consistent with the other bursts, assuming a DM constant of 2.41 x 10^-4 MHz^-2 pc cm^-3 s^-1). The best-fit localization was performed on the voltage data of the two bright events, giving an inverse-variance weighted best position RA (J2000): 321.9162 +- 0.0087 deg, Dec (J2000): 4.3501 +- 0.0124 deg, with errors quoted at 1-sigma uncertainty (Michilli et al. 2021 ApJ, 910, 147). 
 
A preliminary analysis of the voltage data shows that both bright bursts have a Faraday rotation measure consistent with |RM| ~325 rad/m^2 (there is a sign ambiguity because of cable delay effects; Mckinven et al. 2021 ApJ, 920, 138). We also obtain preliminary fluences for the two brightest bursts, averaged over the entire 400-800 MHz CHIME observing band, as 175 +- 22 Jy ms and 919 +- 97 Jy ms (1-sigma uncertainty) for bursts FRB 20240121A and FRB 20240124A, respectively (CHIME/FRB Collaboration arXiv:2311.00111). 
 
Given the large fluences of the bursts and the high estimated burst rate, we encourage rapid multi-wavelength follow-up, especially radio interferometric observations, to further localize FRB 20240114A.

We report the following classifications of AT2024adv and AT2024aju from spectroscopic observations with the Goodman spectrograph on the SOAR telescope using the AEON queue, made on 2024 Jan 23 UT.  The targets were supplied by ATLAS and identified using the target management platform YSE-PZ (Coulter et al., 2023, PASP, 135, 4501). The classifications were performed with SNID (Blondin & Tonry, 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024).

Notes: 
When the redshift is given to 2 decimal places, it is derived from the SN spectrum.  Otherwise, the redshift is determined from the host galaxy. 
 
(1) We measure a Si II 6355 absorption velocity of -10,400 km/s.

We report radio observations of SN 2023xrs (AN 2023-312) conducted with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), project code C3448. The observations were conducted from 12:30 to 18:30 UT on 2023 November 23, centered on frequencies 5.5, 9.0, and 16.7 GHz. From preliminary analysis, we report non-detections in all observed bands, with the following 3-sigma upper limits: < 138 micro-Jy/beam at 5.5 GHz, < 165 micro-Jy/beam at 9 GHz, < 582 micro-Jy/beam at 16.7 GHz. 
 
We have also observed SN 2023xrs with the X-ray Telescope on board the Neil Gehrels Swift observatory (GI prop. 1922064). The observations were conducted along five different epochs, ranging from 2023 November 19 to November 27, with a total exposure time on-source of 9.35 ks. From a preliminary analysis of the stacked X-ray image, we report no X-ray source at the position of SN 2023xrs, with a one-sigma upper limit of 0.0013 ctg/s. Assuming a power-law spectrum with photon index gamma=2, and a Galactic column density of NH = 1.59x10^22 cm^-2 (Kalberla et al. 2005 A&A, 440, 775), we obtain an unabsorbed flux (0.3-10.0 keV) limit of 1.6x10^-13 erg/cm^2/s. 
 
An optical spectrum of SN 2023xrs has also been obtained with the WiFES spectrograph at the Australian National University 2.3-meter telescope located at Siding Spring (AU). The spectrum consists of a single exposure of 750s in both grisms B3000 and R3000. Observations started on December 8, at 11:14 UT. The spectrum shows typical absorption lines observed in type-Ic SNe, including Fe II, Si II, O I, and Ca II NIR, at an expanding velocity of ~ 12,000 km/s, as measured from Ca II NIR and O I 7775 Ang. Using SNID (Blondin & Tonry 2007 ApJ, 666, 1024), we find a best match with the type-Ic SN 2004aw at 5 days from its peak brightness.

We report on additional optical observations of the evolution of the type II supernova SN 2023ixf, which was discovered in May 2023 by K. Itagaki. Due to the relative proximity of the host galaxy Messier 101, that supernova received quite thorough multiwavelength coverage. 
The supernova was serendipitously captured by Bernd Schneider while imaging the host galaxy from La Palma / Canary Islands on JD 2460083. CCD images were taken through a 65mm aperture at a focal length of 426mm and with an exposure time of 60s per frame.

At 15:36:21 UTC on 15 November 2023, GRB 231115A was detected by Fermi/GBM (Fermi GBM Team, GCN 35035 & 35044), INTEGRAL (P. D'Avanzo et al., GCN 35036, S. Mereghetti et al., GCN 35037), Glowbug (C. C. Cheung et al., GCN 35045), and Insight-HXMT (Insight-HXMT team, GCN 35060). The position of GRB 231115A (RA=149.00, DEC=69.68 with an uncertainty of 2 arcmin) is consistent with that of the M82 galaxy (S. Mereghetti et al. GCN 35037). Additionally, the spectrotemporal properties of GRB 231115A suggest it is likely due to a magnetar giant flare (Fermi/GBM Team, GCN 35044, S. Ronchini et al., GCN 35065).

At the time of the high-energy (HE) emission, GRB 231115A was ~20 degrees from the meridian of the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst Project (CHIME/FRB). No radio emission was detected from the source at the time of the HE emission. In addition to searching for radio emission at the time of the Fermi/GBM trigger, we also searched within the CHIME/FRB database for bursts from this position within the last two years, yet did not find any definitive astrophysical associations. 
Using a pipeline described in Curtin et al. (2023), we constrain the FRB-like radio emission from this source in the 400-800 MHz band to be <260 Jy or <720 Jy ms (assuming a 10 ms pulse width) at the time of the Fermi/GBM trigger. The HE fluence reported by Fermi/GBM in the 10-1000 keV range is (6.3 +/- 0.4)e-7 erg/cm^2  (Fermi/GBM Team, GCN 35044). This implies a radio-to-HE emission ratio of <4.5e-9 (unitless assuming a 400 MHz bandwidth). Additionally, using a luminosity distance of 3.5 Mpc to the M82 galaxy (P. D'Avanzo et al. 2023, GCN 35036), our derived radio flux limit corresponds to an upper limit on the radio luminosity of <3.8e30 erg s^-1 Hz^-1.

While GRB 231115A was ~20 degrees from the meridian of CHIME/FRB at the time of the Fermi/GBM trigger, it transited directly overhead CHIME/FRB at 14:18:45 UTC on 15 November 2023. Thus, our best radio constraints for this source are ~80 minutes prior to the Fermi/GBM trigger. As no radio emission was similarly detected at this time, we constrain the radio flux at this time to be <0.5 Jy and the fluence to be <1.2 Jy ms assuming a burst width of 10 ms. This corresponds to a radio luminosity limit of <7.3e27  erg s^-1 Hz^-1 and a radio-to-HE fluence ratio of <7.6e-12 (unitless assuming a 400 MHz bandwidth).

Results of the regular photometric monitoring of the nearby Type II Supernova SN2023ixf from the Astronomical Institute of University of Bern (AIUB) Zimmerwald Observatory (MPC code 026) are presented. Data collection was carried out by the autonomous observing scheduler of the Observatory during all the nights with favorable weather conditions in the month of October/November 2023. The data was acquired in conjunction to the main mission of Zimmerwald, dedicated to near-Earth Space Safety and geodetic Satellite Laser Ranging observations. At every observing occasion, three consecutive 20 seconds images of M101 host galaxy were acquired with the 0.8m ZimMAIN Ritchey-Chretien Telescope, utilizing the full response of the Spectral Instruments SI1100 CCD camera. AstroImageJ (Collins et al. 2017) was utilized for the data reduction and photometry. Standard initial reduction was carried out, consisting of bias subtraction and flat field division, followed by fringe frames correction/subtraction. The individual images were then registered together, median combined and aperture photometry carried out on the resulting frame. Twelve nearby starts present in the GAIA DR3 catalog were used for the photometry calibration and the measurements below are presented as GAIA G band magnitudes.

MJD in the compilation above corresponds to the mid-exposure time of the second image of the sequence (~ middle of the epoch of observation). The transparency note indicates if the conditions were clear or there was some cirrus present at the time of data acquisition. Cases of reduced atmospheric transparency are naturally resulting in increased uncertainties of the measured SN2023ixf magnitudes.  
 
A monotonic steady increase of the measured magnitudes (object dimming) is observed up to Oct. 10, followed by an indication of a slight re-brightening on Oct. 11. The next measurement on Oct. 13 reveals a 0.17 +/- 0.03 magnitudes brightening of SN2023ixf in respect of the weighted mean of the Oct. 08 - 11 measurements (G = 14.37 +/- 0.01).  
 
Unfortunately, next favorable weather conditions occurred about 18 days later and it was not possible to observe the event in more details. Images of the field were acquired on Oct. 21 and 28, but under extremely poor transparency. The two most recent observations on Oct. 31 and Nov. 07 follow the trend of dimming of the object after the brightening event. Two reported MASTER-Amur (Lipunov et al. 2009) measurements acquired with clear filter (14.4 and 14.5 mag.) on Oct. 27 2023 are in good agreement with the aforementioned trend of the Zimmerwald observations as well. A possible preliminary interpretation of the brightening could be a light echo phenomenon. More measurements are needed to study the light curve evolution in further details throughout October and better constrain the event. The regular photometric monitoring of SN2023ixf from the Zimmerwald Observatory will continue.

We report the discovery of a faint fast radio burst by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), namely FRB 20200317A, through reprocessing archival data from the Commensal Radio Astronomy FAST survey (CRAFTS, Li et al. 2018). The data stream is recorded at a sampling time of 98.304 microseconds for 4096 frequency channels in the 1.0-1.5 GHz frequency band. FRB 20200317A was detected S/N~11 with a box-car down-sampling of 13 (+/- 1.2 ) ms duration at UT 21:33:13.958, Mar 17 2020 (MJD 58925.898078225) using a GPU based single-pulse search pipeline (GSP, You et al. 2021). From the logged position of the receiver cabin at the time, we infer that the burst came from the direction of (RA 16h22m45s, DEC +56d44m50s) with a positional uncertainty of ~3 arc-minutes based on the full width of the FAST beam at the center frequency of 1250 MHz. Due to the precision of the localization, no corresponding optical counterpart or host galaxy has been identified. FRB 20200317A exhibits a band-limited feature, the observed DM for the burst (850.7+/-0.4 pc/cc) is substantially greater than the maximum DM expected from the Galaxy in this direction ~34.8 pc/cc (YMW16) and ~52.2 pc/cc (NE2001). The estimated upper limit of the redshift determined from the excess of the DM is approximately 0.8. A preliminary estimate of the burst's fluence is 39.3 (+/- 1.6) mJy ms, which is one of the faintest FRB sources detected so far, according to Blinkverse (https://blinkverse.alkaidos.cn, Xu et al. 2023).

We encourage more target-of-opportunity observations with multi-band facilities. FAST is a Chinese national mega-science facility, built and operated by the National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences (NAOC). We appreciate all the members of the CRAFTS collaboration for their support and assistance during the observations.

We observed the transient AT 2023tbf (GOTO23aky; Gompertz et al., GCN 34738), spatially and temporally consistent with the Fermi GBM GRB 230918B (Fermi GBM team, GCN 34738). We used the ESO VLT UT3 (Melipal) equipped with the X-shooter spectrograph, starting on 2023 September 20.093 UT. Our data cover the wavelength range 3000-24800 Å and consist of 4 exposures of 600 s each.

In the acquisition image, taken on 2023 Sep 20.086 UT, we measure for the transient a magnitude r = 19.64 ± 0.05 AB (calibrated against a single nearby star from the SkyMapper catalog).

A strong continuum is detected in the blue end of the spectrum, with a decreasing signal towards the VIS and NIR arms. The UVB shows several broad undulations, not seen in GRB afterglow spectra; in the VIS and NIR arms, the continuum is smoother.

The source shows narrow absorption from Ca H and K a z = 0, as well as broad features in correspondence of the Balmer lines, at least H-β to H-η, all at z = 0. No features are identified at z > 0. Comparison with template spectra (e.g. Morales-Rueda & Marsh, 2002, MNRAS, 332, 814) allows us to classify AT 2023tbf as a dwarf nova. We thus conclude that AT 2023tbf is not a GRB afterglow and is not associated with GRB 230918B.

Observations continued for 3.9 ks of integrated exposure, with XRT taking data in Photon Counting (PC) mode and UVOT observing in event mode (11 ms timing) with the u filter.  
 
3 uncatalogued X-ray sources are found in the FRB's localization region, consistent with expectations at the depth achieved. None of these sources show signs of variability or otherwise distinguish themselves from background contaminants. The average 3 sigma upper limit over the field was 1.8e-3 ct s-1 (0.3-10 keV). 
 
No uncatalogued sources are detected in the UV, down to a 3 sigma point source limiting magnitude of 21.8 AB mag in the u filter.

The report of the observations campaign with Swift XRT and UVOT instruments 
of the repeating Fast Radio Burst source FRB20220912A (J2000 R.A., Dec.= 347.2704,  
48.7071 deg) during a time interval when the source was reported to be in 
a radio activity phase, with some possible bursting radio pulse actvity 
expected as reported by the NC radio telescope (ATel #16130).

Our Swift X-ray observations are part of a coordinated multiwavelength 
campaign of this FRB including AGILE gamma-ray observations and simultaneous 
radio observations by the Northern Cross radio telescope telescope (408 MHz)  
in Medicina.

We observed the location of FRB20220912A daily from Jul. 25th,  
2023 to Jul. 30th in the following time intervals  
 
Jul 25th, within 00:09 - 02:14 UT, for 1520 s of effective exposure; 
Jul 26th, within 00:05 - 02:02 UT, for 1280 s of effective exposure; 
Jul 27th, within 01:22 - 03:20 UT, for 1677 s of effective exposure;

Jul 29th, within 00:55 - 02:39 UT, for 1705 s of effective exposure; 
Jul 30th, within 02:23 - 02:48 UT, for 1491 s of effective exposure;

We obtained XRT data in Windowed Timing (WT) mode: a preliminary analysis 
indicates that no uncatalogued X-ray source compatible with the FRB  
position was detected in both observations. For the Galactic HI column  
density value in the source direction (n_H = 1.45 x 10^21 cm^-2,  
Kalberla et al. 2005, A&A, 440, 775) and assuming a single power-law  
spectrum of photon index 2, we obtain the following 3-sigma upper  
limits (ULs) in the range 0.3-10 keV:

1.62 x 10^-2 counts/s (flux UL: 5.8 x 10^-13 erg/cm^2/s) for the

We report the detection of four bursts from FRB20220912A using the Green Bank 20-meter telescope. After its discovery by CHIME/FRB (ATel #15679), subsequent observations by a number of telescopes indicated the FRB exhibited an unusually high burst rate. We began two independent follow-up campaigns, one at L-band (1400 MHz) using the Green Bank 20m telescope and one at S-band (2300 MHz) using the Arecibo 12-meter telescope. Observation lengths range from 30 minutes to two hours. The L-band observations consisted of 91 hours of data taken between November 2, 2022 and January 4, 2023. The S-band observations consisted of ~120 hours of data taken between October 22, 2022 and April 8, 2023, with 1-hour daily observations. Both campaigns were supplemented by a 3-hour observation at 820 MHz using the 100-meter Green Bank Telescope (GBT) on January 4, 2023, during which all three telescopes observed the source simultaneously.

One burst was detected by the 12-m Arecibo telescope on October 27, 2022, and has already been reported (ATel#15734). We reduced the data using a simple Fast Dispersion Measure Transform (FDMT; Zackay & Ofek 2017) pipeline, along with a Heimdall-based pipeline, and detected four bright bursts in the 20m data set, at DM ~219 pc/cc, on November 18, November 19, and November 22, with topocentric times at infinite frequency and signal-to-noise ratio ratios (SNRs) given below.

Julian day (MJD)    SNR (Heimdall) 
59901.74800074071 14.89 
59902.81218165855 28.44 
59905.74416028401 33.21 
59905.89238238469 52.02

The January 4 observation featured all three telescopes observing simultaneously for three hours. We detected 25 bursts with the GBT, with the brightest having an SNR of ~270, while the 20m and 12m detected none. While this could be attributed to the large collecting area of the GBT, the extremely high SNRs of the brightest bursts suggest that other effects may be in play. The non-detections may be an indication that FRB20220912A possesses a steep spectrum. More work is underway to understand these bursts.

We report the discovery and interferometric localization of the repeating source FRB 20230814A with the Deep Synoptic Array (DSA-110). Bursts were detected on MJDs 60123.490223 and 60170.360927 at an approximate dispersion measure (DM) of 696.4 pc/cm^3, with detection S/N ratios of 72.6 and 45.1 respectively. Although only intensity data were saved for the former burst, raw voltage data were saved for the latter burst that enabled interferometric localization and full-polarization analysis.

Our best-fit preliminary localization for FRB 20230814A is

22h23m53.9s +73d01m33.3s (J2000)

The uncertainty in this localization is approximately 2"" in RA and 1"" in DEC.

A preliminary analysis of polarimetric data on the MJD 60170 burst from FRB 20230814A shows that it is highly polarized, with both linear and circular polarization detected. A Faraday rotation measure of -19 +- 1 rad/m^2 was estimated.

The MJD 60170 burst from FRB 20230814A was coincident (temporally, spatially, and in DM) with an S/N 17.2 burst candidate reported by the CHIME/FRB VOEvent service. DSA-110 and CHIME are located at nearly the same geographic longitude, and as transit instruments have overlapping regions of sensitivity on the sky.

We encourage follow-up observations of FRB 20230814A. The coincident detection of a burst by DSA-110 and CHIME/FRB motivates radio follow-up across the 400-1500 MHz band.

Data on this source, including a waterfall plot, are linked below.

The DSA-110 is supported by the National Science Foundation Mid-Scale Innovations Program in Astronomical Sciences (MSIP) under grant AST-1836018. This research has made use of the CHIME/FRB VOEvent Service.

The TDE was originally discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) on 2020 October 8 and  classified  as a TDE on 2021 January 15 due to transient broad He II and Balmer lines in a follow-up optical spectrum and bright UV flux.

On 2023 April 1 we observed AT2020vwl with the VLA as part of our ongoing monitoring campaign. The data were reduced in CASA following standard procedures. We report a flux density measurement of the source at 5.5 GHz (C band) of 404+/-22 uJy, which is brighter by a factor of 2 compared to a previous 5.5 GHz flux density measurement of  179+/-17 uJy on 2022 May 8 (Goodwin et al., 2023), indicating a significant re-brightening of the radio emission.

Further VLA observations are planned in order to characterise the spectral shape and the rate at which the source is brightening. We encourage additional multiwavelength follow-up to aid in characterising the cause of this re-brightening."

The radio-emitting magnetar PSR J1809-1943/XTE 1810-197 was recently observed to have undergone a step change to its rotational properties, which was interpreted in ATel #16086 as a glitch in its spin frequency. In the following weeks, having conducted regular follow-up monitoring using the Lovell and Mark II radio telescopes at the Jodrell Bank Observatory, we find that the observed pulse times-of-arrival are better explained by a dramatic and unusual step decrease in the magnetar's spin-down rate of 18% which occurred around MJD 60107.

The MNC is monitoring FRB 20220912A daily since 2023/05/17, ~ 40 mins per day with similar starting times given by its transit, collecting a total of 22.3 hr on source. The search was performed using the SPANDAK pipeline (Gajjar et al. 2018), spanning a DM range between 200 and 240 pc/cm3 with a Signal to Noise Ratio > 7. The bursts properties are reported in waterfall plots at the link below. The four bursts we report have been detected in the last 2 weeks of observations. We note that no bursts from this source have been reported since December 2022 (ATEL #15817, Zhang et al. 2023), hence these detections may suggest a renewed activity of the source.

Subjects: X-ray, AGN, Transient, Tidal Disruption Event

The optical transient AT2019aalc/ZTF19aaejtoy has been suggested to be an AGN tidal disruption event candidate and also potentially the host of the IceCube neutrino event IC191119A (van Velzen et al. 2021). Recently, it was reported to re-brighten in the optical band 4 years after its first flare in April 2019 (Veres et al. 2023).

We started by analyzing the archival XMM-Newton observation (obsID: 0862900501) from 20 February 2021 during optical quiescence. After screening for background/particle flaring we recovered about 15 ks of exposure (3650 counts). We extracted an EPIC-pn spectrum and fit it in the 0.2-10 keV band using the C-statistic with tbabs*zashift(powlaw) and tbabs*zashift(diskbb). The resulting C-stat/degrees of freedom were 160/168 and 312/168, respectively, suggesting that a powerlaw is a better model. The best-fit powerlaw index and the observed 0.3-8 keV flux were 2.61(+0.08,-0.08) and 5.1(+0.1,-0.2)e-13 erg/s/cm^2 (68% confidence), respectively.

We then analyzed the two recent Swift/XRT datasets (obsIDs: 00016080001 and 000160800012) which had a total exposure time of 2138 s. These were taken on the 23 and the 29 of June 2023, respectively. We extracted a combined X-ray spectrum which yielded 59 source counts in the 0.3-8.0 keV band. Modeling the spectrum with a powerlaw (tbabs*zashift(pow) in XSPEC) yields a best-fit powerlaw index of 3.03(+0.43,-0.40) and an observed 0.3-8.0 flux of 8.4(+1.2,-1.2)e-13 erg/s/cm^2 (68% confidence). The best-fit C-stat/degrees of freedom was 14/15.

The most recent powerlaw index is consistent with the value from more than 2 years ago and the X-ray flux is marginally elevated, which is not surprising for a variable AGN. We have requested for NICER observations which should be able to constrain the recent spectrum better.

We have observed a glitch in the pulse arrival times of the radio-emitting magnetar PSR J1809-1943/XTE 1810-197, which we monitor routinely as part of the pulsar timing programme at the Jodrell Bank Observatory. PSR J1809-1943 has a spin-frequency of ~0.2 Hz and a inferred magnetic flux density of ~2E14 G.  We observe this source with an average cadence of once every five days using a 384 MHz wide band, centred on 1520 MHz. The glitch is the first known such event in this source, though it is possible that earlier glitches are obscured by the strong timing noise that is exhibited by the magnetar. The glitch was detected using an automated glitch detection pipeline. Preliminary analysis indicates that the magnetar underwent a step change in spin-frequency of (1.74+/-0.29)E-07 Hz (1-sigma), corresponding to a fractional rotational spin-up of (9.6+/-1.6)E-07. We constrain the glitch epoch to be MJD 60099+/-7. We are continuing to monitor the post-glitch evolution of PSR J1809-1943, in order to identify any step-changes to the spin-down rate and examine any glitch-associated changes to the radio pulse profile. Follow-up observations at other wavelengths are also encouraged."

Following the identification of the first radio-detected SN Ia 2020eyj (Kool et al. 2023), we report individual and further radio observational results with Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA). We obtained two datasets from the NRAO archive, which were observed on 2022 April 14 (Project Code: 22A-472; PI: Javier Moldon) and June 26 (Project Code: 22A-497; PI: Javier Moldon), i.e. 767 and 840 days since discovery, respectively. Both observations were conducted at C-band (the central frequency is 6 GHz) with a bandwidth of 2 GHz. These observations yield clear detection of a radio source at the position of SN 2020eyj with peak flux densities 62.9 +- 8.2 and 63.0 +- 10.1 microJy, respectively. We transfer the 6 GHz peak flux density to 5.1 GHz via the measured in-band spectral indexes and find no evidence for statistically significant radio luminosity decline by comparing JVLA with e-MERLIN observations (see the attached Figure, https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gWQ1_--4EmIIAF9P00tp6RKS9y7QN4vS/view?usp=sharing).

We report an analysis of SN 2023ixf with all-sky survey data from the Large Area Telescope (LAT), on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. The SN 2023ixf was initially reported by K. Itagaki in M101 on May 19 (T0 = 2023-05-19 17:27:15 UTC) and later classified as a Type II SN (Perley et al., AstroNote 2023-119). Since then, it has been monitored at several wavelengths (e.g. ATels #16045, #16047, #16049, #16052, #16073) and neutrino limits have been provided (ATels #16043, #16070).

We searched for emission from a new gamma-ray transient source. Preliminary analysis indicates no significant (> 5 sigma) new excess emission (> 100 MeV) at the optical position of SN 2023ixf (TNS). Assuming a power-law spectrum (photon index = 2.0, fixed) for a point source at the SN 2023ixf nominal position, the >100 MeV flux upper limit (95% confidence) is < 1.9e-8 ph cm^-2 s^-1 (< 2.6e-11 erg cm^-2 s^-1) for a 14-day integration time after its discovery (2023-05-19 17:27:15 to 2023-06-02 17:27:15 UTC). This corresponds to a luminosity limit of < 1.3e41 erg s^-1 for a distance of 6.4 Mpc. No signal with larger fluence is detected either on shorter time scales (from T0 to T0+1, T0+5, or T0+12 days). This limit is about one order of magnitude above the hard X-ray luminosity reported by NuSTAR, which has a power-law index of 1.3 (ATel #16049).

Since Fermi normally operates in an all-sky scanning mode, regular monitoring of this region will continue. For this source the Fermi-LAT contact person is Guillem Marti-Devesa (guillem.marti-devesa@uibk.ac.at).

The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden."

SN 2023ixf is clearly detected with a count rate of (3.56+/-0.14)E-2 ct/s. Our data are best fit with a plasma of temperature ~10 keV and a column density of ~3.2E22 cm-2. As the temperature is at the edge of Chandra sensitivity limit, the temperature is not very well constrained. However, the column density certainly seems to have evolved as compared to the one reported by Grefenstette (ATel # 16049) based on the NuSTAR data taken on 2023 May 22. Our 0.3-10 keV unabsorbed flux is (1.6+/-0.1)E-12 erg/cm2/s, which corresponds to a luminosity of 8E39 erg/s for a distance of 6.4 Mpc.

We report the spectroscopic observations of SN 2023ixf carried out by Hanle Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera (HFOSC) mounted on the Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) on 28th May 2023 (MJD 60092.71773727) under the program HCT-2023-C2-P7/P8. The 3900-9200 A spectrum used the grism elements HFOSC/Gr7  (r=1330) and HFOSC/Gr8  (r=2190). No calibration source was available on the same night. The spectra were calibrated by an earlier nightâs calibration with respect to Feige-66. 
 
The spectrum is still dominated by the  continuum, similar to that observed on 22nd May, 2023 (ATEL #16053). In the Gr7 (3800-7500 A) spectrum, we see a broadened emission line at 4861 A, corresponding to H-beta.  An additional emission feature is present at 4873 A. In the Gr8 spectrum, we see an H-alpha P-Cygni profile with emission peaking at 6568 A and an absorption dip at 6546 A.  
 
Out of the two spectra obtained on 28th May 2023, GELATO runs show Gr7 spectrum is best matched to the template of SN 2008es type II L pec (12.5 days), with a poor Quality of Fit (QoF) factor of 1.03 while the Gr8 is best matched to the template of SN 1998S type IIn (17.5 days) with a better QoF of 2.53. We would however report that the spectrum observed on 22nd May 2023 (#ATEL 16053) was best matched by GELATO to SN 2008es type II L pec (19.5 days) with QoF=1.47. Using an earlier spectrum of SN 2023ixf on 20th May 2023 at HCT reported on the TNS server (ID 15044), and GELATO, we find a match to SN 1998S type IIn (3.5 days) with a QoF of 1.68."

Following the hard X-ray detection of Type II SN2023ixf in M101 by NuSTAR (ATel#16049), we observed its position on May 26 and May 29, 2023 with the Mikhail Pavlinsky ART-XC telescope onboard the SRG observatory. Both observations lasted for nearly 85 ks without interruptions.

The source is confidently detected in both observations up to 20 keV. No variability on the ~10 ks time scale is seen in the continuous light curves in the 4-12 keV energy band. Given the limited ART-XC spectral coverage (5-20 keV), we chose a simple spectral model of an absorbed power law plus a narrow Gaussian line at 6.4 keV, with NH fixed at 2x1023 cm-2  (as reported in ATel#16049). No significant spectral evolution of the continuum is apparent, but the source brightened by a factor of ~1.5, from 1.2x10-12 up to 1.8x10-12 erg cm-2 s-1  in the 5-20 keV energy band over three days, while the flux of the FeKα line significantly decreased from 1.1x10-5  to 0.4x10-5  ph cm-2 s-1.

We report the radio detection of the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2023cvb taken as part of our VLA Large Program dedicated to TDEs. AT2023cvb was first discovered on 2023 March 06 by ATLAS as an optical flare from the host galaxy WISEA J191425.67+414009.4 (TNS Astronomical Transient Report No. 171906). It was later classified by Yao et al as a TDE with the optical spectrum showing a blue continuum and broad hydrogen emission lines at a redshift of z=0.071 (TNS Classification Report No. 14806, AstroNote 2023-102).

We observed AT2023cvb with NSFâs Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), on 2023 May 05 and 2023 May 12 at Ku-band (12-18 GHz). The data were reduced in CASA using standard procedures. We detected radio emission consistent with the optical position, with 13.5 GHz flux densities of 673+/9 uJy (May 5) and 878+/-9uJy (May 12). Additionally, the coordinates of the host galaxy were observed by the VLA Sky Survey on 2023 Feb 13 and there was no detection of the source with a 3 GHz 3 sigma upper limit of <465uJy. The lack of an archival radio detection of the host galaxy and the evolution of the radio emission between the two VLA observations 1 week apart confirm the transient nature of this radio source. Further radio observations to constrain the broadband spectrum have been scheduled with the VLA. We encourage additional multi-wavelength follow up of this interesting transient.

Our VLA Large Program (20B-377) began in December 2020 and will continue through 2023. We target new publicly-reported TDEs discovered at z < 0.1, to determine the prevalence of radio emission in TDEs.

We report on spectroscopic observations of SN 2023ixf, taken with the Hanle Faint Object Spectrograph and Camera (HFOSC)  mounted on the Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT), on 22nd May 2023 (MJD 60086.76755208), under our program HCT-2023-C2-P7/P8. The 3900-9200 A spectrum constitutes of a 720 s exposure in HFOSC/Gr7 (3900-6675 A, r=1330) and a 600 s exposure in  HFOSC/Gr8 (6670-9200 A, r=2190). The spectra were flux calibrated relative to that of Feige 34, taken at similar airmass, on the same night.  
 
 
The composite spectrum (Gr7 + Gr8) is dominated by the hot, UV, continuum, typical of young supernovae. The following emission features are detected: 
 
(a) H-delta peaking at 4097.7 A, possibly blue shifted from rest wavelength of (4102 A), 
 
(b) He II peaking at 4682.6 A, with a half-width velocity of 1280 km/s (approx.). It is superposed on a blend of  C III triplet (4650 A) and [Fe III] (4658 A). 
 
(c) H-beta, centered at 4857.6 A, with a half width velocity 1976 km/s (approx.),   
 
(d) A possibly blue-shifted C IV doublet (5801/5811 A) at 5802.7 A, and, 
 
(e) H-alpha centered at 6562.35 A, with a half width velocity 1325 km/s (approx.). 
 
Additionally, we also find an absorption feature centered at 5893.1 A, corresponding to the galactic  
Na D-doublet. The face-on M101 being at z=0.000804, any such feature from M101 would be faint, and, at the resolution of the HFOSC, indistinguishable from Milky Way's own absorption.  
 
 
The HCT is a part of the Indian Astronomical Observatory (IAO) at Ladakh, operated by the  Indian Institute of Astrophysics (Bangalore, India). We thank the staff at the IAO/HCT and at CREST for their support during the observations. We also thank the proposers of HCT 2023-C2-P04/P05 for sparing the ToO time."

We report the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) radio observations of supernova SN 2023ixf in M101. Our observations took place on 2023 May 22.74 UT in uGMRT band 5 (1000-1450 MHz) at a central frequency of 1255 MHz. We find no evidence of radio emission from SN 2023ixf above a 3-sigma upper limit of 75 microJy at the position of the optical position of the supernova. Our flux density upper limit corresponds to a 3-sigma upper limit to the monochromatic luminosity of 3.7E24 erg/s/Hz. We thank the staff of the GMRT that made these observations possible.

Following the discovery of the Type II supernova SN 2023ixf in the nearby galaxy in M101 (Itagaki 2023) and its X-ray emission (ATel #16049), we have searched for X-ray emission of the supernova and its progenitor with archival data from the Swift X-ray Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Swift TOO observations were triggered shortly after the discovery. Between 2023-05-21 and 2023-05-23, eight Swift/XRT observations were performed. The total Swift/XRT observation time is 10.6 ks. SN 2023ixf is marginally seen in the combined 0.3-10 keV image. There are 13 counts in a circular region of 20 arcsec in radius. With 38 counts in a source-free region covering 2035 pixels, the background is about 0.019 counts per pixel. Using a binomial distribution, the chance probability that all 13 photons or more are background is 0.047%. With 8.8+/-3.7 background subtracted counts and assuming an absorbed power-law with a  photon index of 1.3 and N_H of 2e23 cm^-2 (ATel #16049), the 0.03-30keV flux is 7.7e-13 erg/s/cm^2 corresponding to 3.8e39 erg/s assuming a distance of 6.4 Mpc. Taking the uncertainty into account, this is marginally consistent with the NuSTAR detection (ATel #16049). 
 
We also examined archival Chandra images taken before the onset of the SN to look for X-ray emission from the progenitor. Between 2000 and 2017, Chandra observed M101 for 28 times with a total exposure time of 1.1 Msec. We combined all the observations together; at the position of the SN, the effective exposure time is about 781 ks. No source is visible at the SN position. Assuming the same spectral model, we set a 3-sigma 0.3-10 keV luminosity limit of 2.3e37 erg/s. Using a less absorbed (Galactic N_H=8.5e20 cm^-2) and a softer (photon index=2) spectrum, the 3-sigma 0.3-10 keV luminosity limit is 4.3e36 erg/s."

We searched the HST archival data for the progenitor of SN 2023ixf. A clear source can be seen at the SN position (https://antares.noirlab.edu/loci/ANT2023l4lgj6bhp4rt) in the F814W image from the HST program 9490 (PI: Kuntz), which was observed on UT 2002-11-16. The source is, however, not visible in the bluer bands (F435W and F555W). We measure a preliminary F814W magnitude of 24.39+/-0.08 for the source. Considering it as the candidate progenitor of SN 2023ixf and using a distance modulus of 29.05 for M101 (Shappee and Stanek, 2011, ApJ, 733), we obtain an approximate absolute magnitude (no extinction correction) of -4.66, which is in line with a supergiant progenitor."

The supernova SN 2023ixf was discovered by K. Itagaki in M101. Following the classification as a Type II SN (Perley et al., AstroNote 2023-119) we requested a NuSTAR DDT observation of SN2023ixf. The observation commenced on 2023-05-22T17:56:09, or roughly 3 days after the discovery of the SNe. We downloaded and analyzed the first 20-ks of the quicklook NuSTAR data.

NuSTAR clearly detects a point source at the location of SN 2023ixf. The source is strongly detected from 3-20 keV in NuSTAR. The source spectrum is described by a highly absorbed continuum along with a strong emission line likely associated with neutral Fe near 6.4 keV. The absorbing column is best-fit to be >2e23 cm2 with a power-law index (Gamma) of 1.3. The equivalent width of the Fe line is ~0.9 keV.

The extrapolated broadband (0.03 to 30 keV) flux is 2.3e-12 ergs / cm2 / sec. For a distance of 6.4 Mpc, this corresponds to an intrinsic (absorbed) luminosity of 1.1e40 ergs / s.

The NuSTAR observation is on-going.

We thank the NuSTAR  PI Fiona Harrison for approving this DDT request and the NuSTAR Operations team for the prompt scheduling of this observation."

We report a p-value of 0.18, consistent with background expectation.  
 
We accordingly derive a time-integrated muon-neutrino flux upper limit for this source of E^2 dN/ dE = 7.3 x 10^-2 GeV cm^-2 at 90% CL, under the assumption of an E^-2 power law. 90% of events IceCube would detect from a source at this declination with an E^-2 spectrum have energies in the approximate energy range between 600 GeV and 250 TeV.

Supernova (SN) 2023ixf was discovered by K. Itagaki in the very nearby galaxy (d=6.4 Mpc; Shappee & Stanek 2011, ApJ, 733, 124) Messier 101 (M101; NGC 5457) on 05/19/2023 and has been classified as a Type II SN by Perley et al. (AstroNote 2023-119). Since M101 was a target by several programs during the Spitzer Space Telescope mission, we analyzed publicly available data in order to follow the possible pre-explosion photometric evolution of the progenitor on the archival mid-infrared images. A single-epoch dataset exists obtained during the Spitzer Cryogenic Mission (03/08/2004, program 60 [GORDON_M101], PI: G. Rieke), while the SN field was serendipitously imaged many additional epochs between 2012 and 2019 during the Post-Cryogenic Mission (mostly part of the SPIRITS program; IDs 10136, 11063, 13053, 14089; PI M. Kasliwal). A point source is clearly detectable at 3.6 and 4.5 microns in Spitzer/IRAC images at the coordinates of the SN (RA=14:03:38.51, Dec=+54:18:42:10; Perley et al. 2023) at all epochs between 2004 and 2019, while there is no detection at 5.8 and 8.0 microns obtained in 2004. We determined the mid-IR fluxes of the source by applying simple aperture photometry on the 3.6 and 4.5 micron Spitzer/IRAC images. 
 
While there are some fluctuations, our preliminary dataset -- at least, to within the uncertainties -- does not exhibit significant flux changes in the preceding ~20 yrs before the explosion (which, if would be detected, could be an indication of pre-explosion eruptive mass-loss processes, if this object is the progenitor). Nevertheless, it is worth performing a more detailed analysis of this multi-wavelength, pre-explosion dataset of this object at a future time. It also remains for this object to be confirmed as the progenitor candidate via accurate astrometric registration with images showing the SN. If it is the progenitor candidate, based on weighted means of our preliminary photometry, the object had a brightness at 3.6 and 4.5 microns of 17.6 and 17.2 mag (+/- 0.2 mag in each), respectively. Assuming only Galactic foreground extinction (A[V]=0.024 mag; leading to negligible extinction in the IRAC bands), these correspond to absolute brightnesses of -11.4 and -11.8 mag (+/- 0.3 mag in each). These are both higher than what we would expect for a bare red supergiant (RSG) photosphere (approximately -9.6 and -9.3 mag, respectively), which implies that, if this is a RSG, circumstellar dust may be a factor. We note, for instance, that for SN 2017eaw, the progenitor had luminosities of -11.46 and -11.67 mag in the two Spitzer bands (Van Dyk et al. 2019, ApJ, 875, 136). If the SN 2023ixf progenitor were analogous to the SN 2017eaw progenitor, it may have had an initial mass of approximately 15 solar masses. 
A plot of our preliminary Spitzer photometry on the progenitor candidate for SN 2023ixf can be found at the link below.

We report pre-discovery detection of AT 2023hrq on CCD frames taken with the 0.6/0.9m Schmidt telescope at Piszkesteto Station of Konkoly Observatory, Hungary. The transient was discovered by Pan-STARRS at RA=13:00:06.993, DEC=+27:52:37.70 (2000) on 2023-05-08.399 UT.  
 
At Konkoly Observatory we are regularly monitoring the area of the Coma galaxy cluster. After examining the frames taken before the discovery epoch of AT 2023hrq, we found multiple pre-discovery detections.  
 
The unfiltered frames taken on the same night (with exposure time of 12x120 sec) were co-added to increase the signal-to-noise, then a deep reference image was subtracted from the co-added frames. AT 2023hrq was first detected at the reported position on the subtracted frame taken on 2023-03-22.051 UT. Forced aperture photometry (tied to PS1 w-band magnitudes) resulted in a white-band brightness of 22.0 +/- 0.2 mag, close to the detection limit of 22.4 mag. The last non-detection observed with the same setup during similar conditions occurred on 2023-02-22.136 UT with a limiting magnitude of 22.3.

2023-04-22.922  20.12 (0.05)  
After supplementing the data above  by detections from Pan-STARRS and ATLAS reported on the TNS website and converting the magnitudes to fluxes, we find that the light curve is consistent with the t^2 power-law (the fireball model) with a rise time longer than 50 days, because the transient is still rising. Such a long rise time suggests an unusual transient, maybe a superluminous supernova in a background galaxy. Indeed, the likely host galaxy, SDSS J130006.91+275236.8, has a photometric redshift of z ~ 0.32, which would imply M ~ -21.3 absolute magnitude for AT 2023hrq.  
 
A spectroscopic classification and further photometric monitoring is encouraged."

The young Type II supernova SN 2023gfo (=ATLAS23ioa; TNS AstroNotes 2023-92 and 2023-95) in NGC 4995 has been observed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at 5.5 and 9.0 GHz on 26 April 2023 09:40-12:50 UT. No radio emission was detected to 3-sigma upper limits on the flux density of 0.06 mJy and 0.05 mJy at 5.5 GHz and 9.0 GHz, respectively. Adopting a host galaxy distance of 26 Mpc from NED this implies an upper limit on the 5.5 GHz luminosity of 4.9E+25 erg/sec/Hz. We would like to extend our thanks to the ATCA staff for enabling these observations.

Subjects: X-ray, Magnetar

XTE J1810-197, a transient magnetar with detected pulsations, has shown intermittent outbursts since its discovery in 2003 (Maan et al. 2019). We report on two recent observations of this source as obtained by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory.

The first observation, a 4 ks XRT exposure carried out on 23 March 2023, captured 78 photons in the 0.3-3.0 keV range (obsID 00014973014). This narrow energy range was motivated by the spectral shape, which was extremely soft and not detected above the background above 3 keV. We utilized XSPEC to fit the data with a combination of basic absorption and blackbody models. As the absorbing column was poorly constrained, we fixed its value to N_H=1.67x10^22 cm^-2, the average value for this source given by the HEASARC HI column density calculator (HI4PI Collaboration). These fits result in a blackbody temperature of kT=0.17 keV +/- 0.52z10^-2 keV and a normalization value of norm=5.3x10^-4 +/- 1.6x10^-4, with uncertainties at the 68% confidence level. From this fit, we determine a flux of 7.1x10^-13 +/- 2.2x10^-13 erg/cm^2/s, which implies a luminosity of 5.3x10^32 +/- 1.6x10^32 erg/s, assuming a distance of 2.5 +/- 1 kpc (Ding et al. 2020).

We also examine a more recent 3.3 ks XRT exposure beginning on 14 April 2023 (obsID 00014973016). This subsequent observation captured 148 photons in the 0.3-3.0 keV range. Due to low signal to noise, we were unable to attain good spectral fit in this range. Thus, we utilized the WebPIMMS tools, assuming the absorbed blackbody model and parameters from the previous analysis, to estimate a flux of 9.1x10^-13 +/- 0.75x10^-13 erg/cm^2/s. The resulting luminosity of 6.8x10^32 +/- 0.6x10^32 erg/s is consistent with our previous analysis within their errors.

Looking at the recent BAT light curves for XTE J1810-197 suggests that this source has not had a large outburst recently, though it does display small variations in brightness. Previous analyses of this transient magnetar (ATel #12689) yielded hotter blackbody temperatures than the ones discussed here, which may suggest a change in this source's properties over time. The soft nature of our spectra and different models likely also account for the discrepancies. We suggest further follow up measurements and observations in the X-ray range due to these factors and high errors on our measured luminosity.

The redshift derived from the SNID template fits and the transients' close proximity to the dwarf galaxy SDSS J160037.30+194252.6 (z = 0.0415) favor the transient being associated with this host galaxy as opposed to the nearby bright galaxy IC1156 (z = 0.0312).

FAST has been monitoring FRB 20121102A nearly biweekly since the beginning of 2023. The central beam of the FAST L-band-focal-plane Array of 19 beams (FLAN) was pointing to RA = 05h31m58.70s, DEC = +33d08m52.5s (Chatterjee et al. 2017). Pulsar-searching data were taken with a 49.152 microsecond sampling and 4096 frequency channels covering  1.0 GHz to 1.5 GHz.  
 
Since the last active episode (ATEL 13959), FAST detected at least 100 bursts from FRB 20121102A in 2023. During the observation on March 3rd, a bright burst was detected at MJD 60006.51262001.  
 
The Faraday rotation measure (RM) derived from this polarised pulse by using the RM-synthesis method is +30755-15+10 rad m-2, continuing the decreasing trend of  FRB 20121102A's RM, which had been observed between 2016-2019 (Michill et al. 2018; Hilmarsson et al. 2021). Our measurement is the first RM measurement since 2019 and is much smaller than the earlier detections (Michill et al. 2018; Hilmarsson et al. 2021), suggesting  significant changes of the environment, which was also indicated by the DM decrease (ATEL 13959). The average decrease of RM is roughly 1.02 x 105rad m-2 per year since 2019. We encourage more follow-up monitoring efforts with multi-band facilities.     
 
FAST is a Chinese national mega-science facility, built and operated by the National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences (NAOC). We appreciate all the members in the FAST FRB key science project collaboration for their support and assistance during the observations.

We report new radio observations of the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2022wtn taken as part of our VLA Large Program dedicated to TDEs. AT2022wtn was first discovered as ZTF22abkfhua on 2022 October 2 as an optical flare (TNS Astronomical Transient Report No. 160738 by ZTF). It was later classified on 2022 November 21 as a TDE at a redshift of z=0.049 (TNS Classification Report No. 13873).

We observed AT2022wtn with NSF's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) on 2023 January 7.90 UT and 2023 March 20.67 UT at a mean frequency of 15 GHz. We reduced the data in CASA using standard procedures. We report the detection of a point source at 15 GHz (Ku band) with coordinates (RA, Dec) 23:23:23.79, +10:41:07.75, and a positional uncertainty of 0.04 arcseconds in each coordinate. This emission is coincident with the optical coordinates of AT2022wtn. In our first epoch, we marginally detected radio emission with a flux density of 20 +/- 7 μJy. In our second observation, the source had brightened to 223 +/- 6 μJy, confirming the transient nature of the emission and its association with the TDE. Further VLA radio observations to constrain the broadband spectrum of the source have been scheduled. We encourage additional multi-wavelength follow up.

Our VLA Large Program (20B-377) began in December 2020 and will continue until October 2023. We are targeting new publicly-reported TDEs discovered at z < 0.1, to determine the prevalence of radio emission in TDEs. We will report new results from this program to the community via ATels, TNS AstroNotes, and on our program website (https://www.as.arizona.edu/radiotdes).

We report an optical spectrum of AT 2023bee (350-870nm) obtained on 2023 Feb. 01.75 UT with the Lijiang 2.4-m telescope (LJT +YFOSC) at Lijiang observatory of Yunnan Observatories. The spectrum is similar to the type Ic supernovae in the early phase. Cross-correlation with the library of supernova spectra using the comparison tool SNID (Blondin and Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024) shows that it matches the fairly peculiar type Ic supernova PTF12gzk = -10 days at the given redshift = 0.0067 of the host galaxy NGC 2708. The expansion velocity of this SN, derived from Si II 6355 and Ca II IRT, is about 28,000 - 32,000 km/s."

In  ATel #15783  , we reported the discovery of FRB20221128A with the UTMOST-NS facility. The FRB was reported at a position of RA = 07:30(10), DEC = -41:32(1) with a fluence of ~ 130 +/- 30 Jy ms, pulse width ~ 5.5 +/- 0.7 ms and with a detection signal-to-noise ratio = 9.0.

However, during the course of additional processing, we have identified that the FRB candidate that triggered the UTMOST-NS voltage download system actually originated in a side-lobe. UTMOST-NS processes 192 beams simultaneously and all candidates are logged. When a candidate is found, push notifications for additional FRB candidates are suppressed while the trigger download is in progress. The voltage download was triggered by the side-lobe detection, which led to the much brighter bore-sight FRB candidate to be overlooked. Accordingly, our early estimate of the position and brightness of FRB20221128A are now significantly revised. The detection S/N in the brightest beam is 111, leading to a revised provisional estimate (lower limit) of the FRB fluence to be 1000 +/- 250 Jy ms (corrected for attenuation of the primary beam in the NS direction, but not in the EW direction), making FRB20221128A one of the brightest FRBs detected to date. The optimal dispersion measure (DM) that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio is very slightly revised to 503.6 pc cm^-3. Given the greatly increased S/N, we fit the FRB as a Gaussian convolved with an exponential scattering tail - the FRB is well fit by a single Gaussian component of width 1.06 +/-0.04 ms and scattering time of 3.30 +/- 0.07 ms at 831.25 MHz. The revised FRB position is RA = 07:30(10), DEC = -42:30(1) in equatorial (J2000) coordinates, which corresponds to Galactic coordinates: Gl = 255.1 deg, Gb = -11.4 deg  (we additionally note that the Galactic coordinates in  ATel #15783   were in error). While the right ascension is unchanged, the declination is ~1 degree from the originally estimated position.

At the revised location, the NE2001 model (Cordes and Lazio, 2002) predicts a total Milky Way DM along this sightline of ~300 pc cm^-3, while the YMW16 model (Yao, Manchester, and Wang, 2017) predicts ~250 pc cm^-3. If, in line with typical practice, we assume a contribution from the Milky Way halo of 50 pc cm^-3 and a further 50 pc cm^-3 contribution from the FRB host galaxy, the predicted intergalactic excess DM now could thus range from ~100 to ~150 pc cm^-3, making FRB20221128A still likely to originate from a relatively nearby galaxy.

We report the detections of bright fast radio bursts from FRB 20220912A using the Westerbork-RT1 25-m telescope at 332 MHz.  
 
After the discovery of the highly active repeater FRB 20220912A by CHIME/FRB (ATel #15679), we started a high-cadence monitoring campaign using 25-m and 32-m class European radio telescopes. We have been observing the source almost daily at C-, L-, and P-band using the Stockert (Germany), Westerbork (Netherlands) and Torun (Poland) radio telescopes. Depending on availability of the telescopes we observe simultaneously at complementary wavelengths. Additionally we have had overlapping coverage with the LOFAR Core stations in the Netherlands and the international IE613 LOFAR station in Ireland.  
 
Here we report the discovery of four bright bursts detected during 156 h of observing at P-band. Observations were conducted at a central frequency of 332 MHz with a bandwidth of 64 MHz using the Westerbork RT-1 radio telescope. We have a significant drop in sensitivity in the top 8 MHz and therefore mask these channels. The receiver has a system equivalent flux density (SEFD) of 2100 Jy.  
 
 
The properties of the detected bursts are: 
 
 
Burst 1:  
Fluence: 426 +/- 86 Jy ms  
Arrival time (MJD, TDB): 59905.8871460520  
 
Burst 2:  
Fluence: 176 +/- 35 Jy ms  
Arrival time (MJD, TDB): 59911.8835634820  
 
Burst 3:  
Fluence: 438 +/- 88 Jy ms  
Arrival time (MJD, TDB): 59912.9809171292  
 
Burst 4:  
Fluence: 892 +/- 179 Jy ms  
Arrival time (MJD, TDB):  59922.8202534060  
 
The arrival time is referenced to infinite frequency at the solar system barycentre (in TDB) using a dispersion measure (DM) of 219.46 pc cm^-3, as determined by CHIME/FRB in the discovery ATel (#15679), and DM constant of 1/2.41e-4 MHz^2 pc^-1 cm^3 s.  
Each of the four detected bursts had overlap with a subset of the following observations, where we found no counterparts: 151 MHz (VHF-band, IE613 LOFAR station), 1.37 GHz (L-band, Stockert), 1.41 GHz (L-band, Torun) and 4.6 GHz (C-band, Torun). We can place an upper limit on the fluence assuming an 8-sigma 1-ms detection threshold of 30 Jy ms, 7 Jy ms, 14 Jy ms and 11 Jy ms, respectively.  
 
 
During our campaign we have also detected many tens of bursts at 1.4 GHz (L-band) ranging between 10-1000 Jy ms while no bursts were found at 4.6 GHz (C-band) in hundreds of observing hours, see also ATel #15727. The analysis of all detected bursts, in both L- and P-band, are currently in preparation as part of a forthcoming paper.

We observed these near-Earth asteroids with a Celestron 0.35-m f/11 robotic telescope equipped with a SBIG ST -7XME camera and RGB filters on Mount Teide (ES) (MPC code G40). We acquired RGB sequences on June 3.107, 6.068, and 6.951, 2013 (1998 QE2), and on June 25.057, and 26.211, 2014 UT (2003 GS). The instrumental magnitudes of these asteroids were calibrated by differential photometry using 10 to 15 comparison stars on the images. The Johnson-Kron-Cousins magnitudes in the V-band and the B-V and V-R color indices of the comparison stars were estimated by applying a polynomial relation between the 2MASS J-K color and the BVRI magnitudes of the Landolt standard stars proposed by Warner (2007, MPBu, 34, 4). The determination of the instrumental multicolor magnitudes and the calibrated B-V and V-R color indices, as well as the V magnitudes, was performed with a program written in Python using the photometric routines of the Astropy project's photutils package (Astropy Collaboration et al. 2013, A&A, 558, 33A).  
 
The weighted mean colors of these objects are B-R=1.0+/-0.1 and 1.2+/-0.1; V-R=0.37+/-0.02 and 0.47+/-0.03, respectively. These values are similar to those of Hicks et al.(2013, Atel, 5121) (B-R=1.05+/-0.01; V-R=0.35+/-0.02) and Hicks et al.(2014, Atel, 6090) (B-R=1.2+/-0.01; V-R=0.47+/-0.01)."

as a Type-I superluminous supernova (SLSN-I) using NOT ALFOSC and grism 4 on 2022-12-14 20:42:40.706. 
The spectrum shows clearly the W (OII absorption) feature, characteristic of SLSNe-I before maximum light, 
at a redshift of z ~ 0.13. It has been rising in flux for about 30 days since the first ZTF detection on MJD = 59898.223 (2022-11-15 05:20:42). 
The last ZTF detections have magnitudes g = 18.495 +/- 0.085 (on MJD = 59928.198, 2022-12-15 04:44:29) and 
r = 18.418 +/- 0.084 (on MJD = 59928.175,  2022-12-15 04:12:25). 
Taking into account the Galactic extinction (Ag = 0.42, Ar = 0.29; Schlafly et al. 2011), the last absolute magnitudes are Mg = -20.79, Mr = -20.74. 
The likely host galaxy is a faint, blue, resolved source detected in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys at  < 0.2"" from the SN position 
and magnitudes g = 22.99, r = 22.56, and z = 22.14. We encourage photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations.

We report the detection of more than a hundred bursts from FRB 20220912A in uGMRT Band 3 (300-500 MHz) and Band 4 (550-750 MHz) observations. The bursts show varying morphology and the emission distributed across different bursts cover the entire observed frequency range of 300 MHz to 750 MHz. 
 
 
The source was observed on November 22 and 24, 2022, as a target of opportunity, following previous ATels (#15679, #15691, #15693, #15695, #15696, #15699, #15713, #15716, #15720, #15723, #15727, #15734, #15735) stating that FRB 20220912A was in a highly active state. On November 22, starting UTC 16:58:40 and 17:56:26, we conducted observations in the phased-array (PA) mode individually in Band 3 and Band 4 respectively, with around 30 minutes on-source time in each of the bands. On November 24, starting UTC 17:36:25, we observed the source simultaneously in Band 3 and Band 4 utilizing the dual-subarray PA mode for about a total of 1.3 hrs on-source time. 
 
 
From our preliminary analysis, we have detected at least 32 bursts in Band 3 and 28 bursts in Band 4 above a signal-to-noise ratio detection threshold of 8, from our observations on November 22. The brightest detected bursts suggest that the fluence at the brighter end of the distribution is in excess of 5 Jy ms at Band 3 as well as Band 4. The bursts show a variety of morphologies, and temporal and spectral structures. Some of the bursts show emission at frequencies as low as 300 MHz. Some of the narrow bursts indicate the scatter broadening to be less than or around 15 ms at 400 MHz. A few examples of the bursts from each of the two bands can be found at: http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/~ymaan/FRB20220912A_ATel.html   . 
 
 
In addition, from our simultaneous dual-band observations, we have detected 26 bursts in Band 3 and 45 bursts in Band 4 so far, out of which around 9 bursts appear to indicate emission that is detected in both the bands simultaneously. 
 
 
Further analysis of these bursts as well as more refined search is underway. Given the current active state of FRB 20220912A, it will be useful to continue observing it in multiple bands. 
 
 
 
We thank the staff of the GMRT for their support and assistance with these observations. The GMRT is run by the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.

The young core-collapse supernova SN 2022acko (=DLT22v/ATLAS22bnms/ZTF22abyivoq; TNS Astronomical Transient Report No. 166420) in NGC 1300, classified as a type IIP event, has been observed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at 5.5 and 9.0 GHz on 08 Dec 2022 10:20-13:05 UT. No radio emission was detected to 3-sigma upper limits on the flux density of 0.045 mJy and 0.035 mJy at 5.5 GHz and 9.0 GHz, respectively. Adopting a host galaxy distance of 19 Mpc from Lee et al. 2022 (arXiv:2212.02667) this implies an upper limit on the 5.5 GHz luminosity within 3 days of explosion of 1.9E+25 erg/sec/Hz.

We observed FRB 20220912A on 2022 November 12 from 13:21:00 to 15:21:00 UTC with the Lovell telescope at Jodrell Bank Observatory, UK at  L (1.4 GHz) band and the 70-m Deep Space Network (DSN) telescope DSS-63 in Robledo, Spain at S (2.2 GHz) and X (8.25 GHz) bands simultaneously from 13:21:24 - 15:30:24 UTC. 
 
For the observations with the Lovell Telescope, the data were sampled at 62.5 nanoseconds over an effective bandwidth of 300 MHz. The coarsely channelized (22 subbands spanning 16 MHz each) voltages were then saved to disk for offline analysis. Simultaneously, data were filterbanked and downsampled to a time resolution of 256 microseconds. Known channels were flagged for interference before cleaning the data. The cleaned filterbank data were then searched for bright, single pulses.  
 
We recorded dual polarization baseband data simultaneously at 2200-2300 MHz (S-band) and 8207-8335 MHz (X-band) for the DSN observations. The S-band data were channelized into 1024 channels with a time resolution of 10.24 microseconds and X-band into 128 channels with a time resolution of one microsecond. S-band data were dedispersed at a DM value of 219.46 pc/cc and single pulse searches were performed with an SNR threshold of 7. 
 
We detected three bursts at L-band in these observations (B1L, B2L, and B3L) at topocentric arrival times of MJD 59895.5586924, 59895.5994775, and 59895.6239375, with fluences of 4.7 Jy-ms, 13.4 Jy-ms, and 2.3 Jy-ms respectively. Two bursts were detected at S-band with topocentric arrival times of MJD 59895.5584776 and 59895.635701 (B1S, B2S) and fluences of 1.5 Jy-ms and 2.1 Jy-ms. We also searched the X-band data around the DSN S-band bursts as well as around the L-band bursts reported at Lovell and detected no bursts above our threshold value 0f 0.5 Jy-ms. 
 
The L-band bursts are not coincident with the bursts seen at S-band, showing the band-limited nature of bursts from this FRB. We encourage continued monitoring of the source over a range of radio frequencies."

At UTC 2022-11-28-17:02:22.72 (2022-11-28.70999), we discovered a Fast Radio Burst (FRB) with the revamped North-South arm (""UTMOST-NS"") of the Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope (owned and operated by the University of Sydney).

UTMOST-NS is a 1.6 km long North-South array, restored to full operations in 2019-2021 (Deller and Flynn, 2020).  It has 45 MHz of usable bandwidth contained within a 50 MHz of sampled band split into 512 channels and centred on 835.25 MHz. There are 66 dual polarisation stations spread across the arm, of which 36 were operational at the time of detection. It was operating in drift-scan mode with pointing centred on the meridian at the time of detection. Due to the one-dimensional nature of the detector, localisation precision is high in Declination (~1 arcmin at 1-sigma) but low in Right Ascension (~2 deg at 1-sigma) (Mandlik et al 2022 in prep).

FRB20221128A was identified during a blind FRB search programme in real-time using an automated GPU-accelerated search pipeline, which makes use of a novel Convolutional Neural Network-based, spatially-aware pipeline (""Adjacent Beam Classifier"", or ABC) to distinguish real astrophysical signals from radio frequency interference in real time. This triggered a voltage dump within 12 sec of the FRB arrival time, enabling 1.3 seconds of raw voltage data centred on the FRB to be recorded from each station for offline processing. This saved voltage data completely contains the dispersed FRB signal (which is spread across ~362 ms from the top to the bottom of the band).

The optimal dispersion measure (DM) that maximises the signal-to-noise ratio is 505.6 +/- 1.8 pc cm^-3. The NE2001 model (Cordes and Lazio, 2002) predicts a total Milky Way DM along this sight-line of ~400 pc cm^-3, while the YMW16 model (Yao, Manchester, and Wang, 2017) predicts ~250 pc cm^-3.  If, in line with typical practice, we assume a contribution from the Milky Way halo of 50 pc cm^-3 and a further 50 pc cm^-3 contribution from the FRB host galaxy, the predicted intergalactic excess DM could thus range from ~0 to ~150 pc cm^-3, making FRB20221128A likely to originate from a relatively nearby galaxy.

An early estimate (lower limit) of the event's apparent fluence is ~130 +/- 30 Jy ms   (corrected for attenuation of the primary beam in the NS direction, but not in the EW direction), width ~5.5 +/- 0.7 ms, with a detection signal-to-noise ratio = 9.0.

The most likely position is RA = 07:30(10), DEC = -41:32(1), J2000 which corresponds to Galactic coordinates: Gl = 177.1 deg, Gb = 24.45 deg.

GECAM-B was triggered in-flight by a long burst at 2022-11-24T02:00:25.650 UTC (T0) and 2022-11-24T02:05:49.550 respectively, which was also observed by CALET (GCN #32981) and Konus-Wind. 
 
The GECAM-B ground calculated location (J2000) is: 
 
RA: 313.6 deg 
 
Dec: 34.4 deg 
 
Err: 3.9 (1-sigma, statistical only) 
 
The systematic error of this location is estimated to be ~2 degrees. 
 
The GECAM-B light curve shows a complicated structure with many bumps and peaks, with a total duration of ~470 sec from T0-70 s to T0+400 s. The time-averaged spectrum from this time interval can be fitted by a simple power law with the spectral index of gamma = -1.34+-0.04. The fluence (20-1000 keV) in this time interval is 1.1 E-5 erg/cm^2.  
The GECAM-B light curve is at ""http://twiki.ihep.ac.cn/pub/GECAM/GRBList/GECAM_221124A.png"". 
 
We also performed a timing analysis of this burst. There appears to be quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO) at the period of about 3 seconds throughout the burst, with a significance of ~3 sigma. This analysis is based on the 10 ms GECAM-B light curve, from T0 + 300 s to T0 + 370 s. The power spectrum is normlizied to Leahy power. A peak power of ~60 is found at 0.32 Hz, with possible excess power at 0.41 Hz and 0.5 Hz. 
 
We note that there has been no significant QPO signal detected during the main bursts of GRBs before, and the overall light curve of this burst looks atyptical for a GRB. We also note that this burst resembles the behavior of black holde X-ray binaries; the GECAM location coincides with the Galactic plane, thus the possiblity of a Galactic origin of this burst could be not excluded.  
 
Since this burst seems not be a (typical) GRB, we tentatively name this source as GECAM 221124A. Follow-up observations are encouraged. 
 
All analysis shown above is preliminary. Final results will be reported.

BAT confirms that SGR 1935+2154 is in a moderately-high bursting state as reported in GCN #32922 (Wood for Fermi/GBM, 2022) with 4 identified bursts in the past 2 days.

In addition, BAT has detected and identified two recent bursts from SGR 1806-20.  Therefore this source should be considered as a candidate source when SGR-like bursts are detected by non-imaging instruments.

AT2022lri/ZTF22abajudi is a tidal disruption event (TDE) at z=0.032 (Yao et al. 2022, TNS Astronote, 223, 1). Soft 0.3-2 keV X-ray emission was detected by Swift/XRT on 2022 October 23. 
 
High-cadence X-ray monitoring of this TDE is conducted with the NICER telescope (GO program 5035; PI Yao). From October 25 to November 10, NICER obtained 67 ks of observations. The minimum and maximum 0.3-1.2 keV fluxes are 4.1+/-0.3 count/s and 51.2+/-1.2 count/s, respectively. Hour-timescale X-ray variability is present. The average 0.3-1.2 keV flux on November 10 is 3.3+/-0.1 e-11 erg/s/cm^2 (=1.5 mCrab).  
 
Defining X-ray flares to be flux variations by more than a multiplicative factor of five, we observed four flares that peaked on MJD 59880.6, 59883.2, 59887.0, and 59892.7. The flares are significant in both 0.3-0.5 keV and 0.5-1.2 keV, but are more extreme in the harder band. We computed the hardness ratio as HR=(H-S)/(H+S), where S and H are the counts in 0.3-0.5 keV and 0.5-1.2 keV, respectively. The variations of flux and HR are correlated, and the evolution roughly follows log(0.3-1.2 keV count rate) = 2.5 x HR + 1.9. For this preliminary analysis, background subtraction was not performed.  
 
We note that similar strong day-timescale X-ray flares are rarely observed in TDEs. Further multi-wavelength observations and X-ray grating spectroscopy are strongly encouraged."

After the recent re-activation of the magnetar SGR 1935+2154 on 2022 October 12 (GCN#32675, Atel #13685, #15667), we activated our XMM-Newton+NuSTAR pre-approved ToO program.

Two XMM-Newton observations were acquired on 2022 October 15 (Start: 2022-10-15 19:39:46 UTC, End: 2022-10-16 12:10:02 UTC; exposure time: 42 ks) and 2022 October 22 (Start: 2022-10-22 03:13:53 UTC, End: 2022-10-22 22:18:05 UTC; exposure time: 48 ks). Two NuSTAR observations were also performed on 2020 May 20 (Start: 2022-10-18 21:51:09 UTC, End: 2022-10-20 00:56:09 UTC; exposure time: 50 ks) and on 2022 October 22 (Start: 2022-10-22 22:21:09 UTC, End: 2022-10-24 03:11:09 UTC; exposure time: 51 ks).

The source was detected up to 25 keV at both epochs and several short X-ray bursts were observed. We performed a joint fit for the quasi-simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR spectral data in the 0.3-25 keV energy range. The spectrum of the persistent emission was well modeled by an absorbed black-body model plus a power-law component. We fixed the hydrogen column density to N_H = 2.3e22 cm^-2 (Borghese et al. 2022). We derived a blackbody temperature kT = 0.46+/-0.01 keV and a power-law photon index Gamma = 1.45+/-0.02 for the first epoch, and kT = 0.45+/-0.01 keV, Gamma = 1.33+/-0.02 for the second epoch (1 sigma c.l.). We reported a 0.3-25 keV observed flux of (1.375+/-0.001)e-11 ergs/cm^2/s and (1.170+/-0.001)e-11 ergs/cm^2/s for the first and the second epoch, respectively.

We derived a phase coherent timing solution covering the 59868.006-59857.544 MJD period. Our timing analysis led us to estimate a spin frequency of F0 = 0.30752682(4) Hz (P = 3.2517489(4) s) and a spin frequency derivative of F1=-5.2(1)x10^-12 Hz/s (Pdot = 5.5(1)x10^-11 s/s) with a reference epoch 59868.16 MJD (2022-10-16 03:50:24 UTC).

We report the detection of radio bursts from the repeating source FRB 20220912A (CHIME/FRB collaboration ATel #15679) using the Allen Telescope Array (ATA). For these observations, 20 of the 42, 6.1-m dishes were tuned to two independent 672 MHz spectral bands, one centered at 1.4 GHz, and another at 3 GHz. The data from the 20 available antennas were then coherently summed, detected and time-integrated to produce final data products at 0.5 MHz and 64 microsecond resolution. The data were then processed using the GPU-accelerated dedispersion algorithm, HEIMDALL (Barsdell 2012) and the candidate-vetting algorithm SPANDAK (Gajjar et al. 2018). For our observations, we first pointed at the coordinates provided by the initial DSA-110 localisation (23h09m05.49s + 48d42m25.6s, ATel #15693) and then the updated DSA-110 coordinates from ATel #15716 (23h09m04.9s +48d42m25.4s).

Eight bursts from FRB 20220912A were detected since the CHIME/FRB collaboration detection between Oct 15th 2022 and Oct 29th 2022. The bright bursts detected by the ATA exhibit the ""downward drifting"" effect as typically seen with other repeating FRBs, and the bursts' pulse and subpulse fluence vary between 10 and 330 Jy-ms at L-band. No simultaneous bursts above the detection limit (4 Jy-ms for 1 ms burst) were detected at 3 GHz at the time of the bright pulses.

Additional observations of FRB 20220912A with the ATA are currently underway. The detections described here, as well as others, indicate that the source is still highly active, and we encourage robust follow-up.

SPANDAK plots for the 8 bursts detected so far with the ATA, and ""filterbank"" files for the brightest three (MJDs = 59880.272023, 59880.395557, 59880.402931) can be found  here. Additional data are available upon request."

We report the detection of a bright radio burst from the repeater FRB 20220912A (ATel #15679) with the 12-m telescope at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. The observation was carried out at 2.3 GHz with a bandwidth of 172 MHz and a sampling time of 128 us. The coordinates used for the observation were RA (J2000) = 23h09m04.9s, Dec (J2000) = +48d42m25.4s, according to the localization constrained by DSA-110 (ATel#15716).  
  
We observed the FRB for an hour daily from 2022-10-22, and a bright burst was detected on 2022-10-27 at 21:38:55.75 UTC with a signal-to-noise ratio of 22. The dispersion measure of the burst was 220.094 pc/cm^3, which is consistent with the reported bursts, and the pulse width was ~0.83 ms, leading to a fluence of ~5.8 Jy ms. 
  
The FRB is active and bright across a broad frequency range, including the S-band frequency. Our high-frequency detection provides vital information about its spectral properties and emission characteristics.

We report the discovery of late-time radio emission from the TDE AT2019teq with the Very Large Array (VLA).  AT2019teq (z=0.0878) was discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) on 20 October 2019 02:47:36 UT.  Swift-XRT observations between December 2019 to May 2020 (55 - 200 days post discovery) revealed a soft X-ray spectrum with a powerlaw with an index of 3.52 (+0.53,-0.45; ATel #15657), and subsequent XMM-Newton observations in September 2022 (~1054 days after discovery) showed a similar X-ray spectrum with a best-fit powerlaw index of 2.99+-0.01 (ATel #15657).  NICER observations on 18 October 2022 and 21 October 2022 showed a best fit powerlaw index was 1.82+/-0.12, indicating the spectrum has significantly hardened within <2 months and the X-ray corona may be actively forming (ATel #15724).

VLA observations were carried out from 18 October 2022 at 23:26:20.0 to 19 October 2022 at 00:26:05.0 (UTC) as part of an ongoing VLA program to study late-time TDE emission (22B-205).  We report a detection at 6 GHz (C-band) of 0.238 +/- 0.008 mJy, consistent with the optical position.  We reduced the data using standard CASA procedures.  We note that two Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) observations of the coordinates exist, both of which are upper limits: VLASS 1.2 (4 October 2017) was <0.310 mJy, and VLASS 2.2 (13 August 2020) was <0.329 mJy (both 3 sigma).

Further multi-frequency VLA observations are planned to study the time evolution of the radio emission.  We thank the NRAO staff for supporting these observations."

We observed the recently discovered FRB 20220912A (ATel #15679) with an ad-hoc VLBI network as part of the PRECISE project. We targeted the source on three occasions: 22 Oct UT 00:00-04:30, 24-25 Oct UT 21:00-02:00, and 26-27 Oct UT 23:00-04:30. The first two observations were carried out at L-band (1254-1510 MHz) while the latest one was performed at C-band (4798-5054 MHz). During the two L-band sessions we were pointing at the coordinates found by DSA-110 (23h09h05.49s +48d42m25.6s, J2000, ATel #15693) and refined this to the updated DSA-110 localisation from ATel #15716 (23h09h04.9s +48d42m25.4s, J2000) for the C-band session. Since these are VLBI observations, the target scans were interrupted by calibrator scans, reducing the total time on source to 160 minutes during the L-band runs and 197 minutes during the C-band run. 
 
 
We recorded the raw voltages (aka baseband data) as 2-bit samples, storing both left and right circular polarisations at all participating stations. Being the most sensitive dish in the array, the baseband data from the Effelsberg telescope were transferred to a processing node at Onsala Space Observatory where they were processed to generate total intensity (Stokes I) filterbanks at time and frequency resolution of 64 microseconds and 62.5 kHz at L-band, and 16 microseconds and 1 MHz at C-band. The data were then searched using the Heimdall software package (limiting the DM search range to 170-270 pc/cm^3) and candidates were selected as real using the ML-classifier FETCH (Agarwal et al. 2020). 
 
 
In total we detected 49 bursts in the Effelsberg data during the L-band run on 22 Oct and another 113 bursts during the L-band run on 24-25 Oct. This corresponds to rates of 18 and 42 bursts/hour, respectively, which is lower than the rate found in ATel #15723 (assuming similar sensitivity thresholds). We note though that during our observations the number of bursts per scan changed significantly between scans, ranging from 1 to 10 bursts per 5-minute scan on source (12-120 bursts/hour). 
 
 
On the contrary, we detected no bursts at C-band on 26-27 Oct above a 7-sigma detection limit of 0.22 Jy ms. Since it is unlikely that the source became inactive within about 45 hours, we conclude that the source is either a) inactive at C-band or burst rates are significantly lower than at L-band, b) C-band emission misses Earth because of (potentially relativistic) beaming leading to a smaller emission cone, or c) the source does emit at C-band but outside the frequency range probed by our observations. 
 
 
Simultaneously with our L-band observations on 22 Oct, the Stockert telescope was also observing FRB 20220912A. They detected a burst from the source at UT 02:14:50.491 (topocentric, DM=219.46, reference frequency 1430 MHz) which falls within a time when Effelsberg was still slewing. Manual inspection of data from some of the smaller stations in our array (Medicina, Noto, Torun) showed that they were already on source and detected the burst as well. The particular burst in question can be found here. 
 
 
Correlation of the VLBI data is underway, in order to achieve a robust milliarcsecond-level localisation.

AT2019teq/ZTF19accmaxo is a tidal disruption event (TDE) at a redshift of 0.0878 identified by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) on 20 October 2019 02:47:36 UT. Swift-XRT observations between December 2019 to May 2020 (55 - 200 days post discovery) revealed a soft X-ray spectrum that can be  modeled with a powerlaw with an index of 3.52 (+0.53,-0.45; ATel#15657). Subsequent XMM-Newton  observations in September 2022 (roughly 1054 days after discovery) showed a similar X-ray spectrum with a best-fit powerlaw index of 2.99+-0.01 (ATel #15657).

NICER carried out two observations of the source on 18 October 2022 (MJD 59872.79 to 59872.99) and 21 October 2022 (MJD 59873.04 to 59873.57), approximately 1100 days after its optical discovery. The 4.5 ks of NICER data shows a  0.3 - 1.5 keV mean background-subtracted count rate of 0.69+/-0.02 cps, for which we performed a combined spectral fitting using a TBabs*zashift(clumin*powerlaw)+gaussian model in XSPEC. The TBabs nH value was fixed at 0.045e+22, and the centroid energy for the gaussian component  was constrained to be between 0.5 - 0.6 keV with a fixed width of 0.0 keV to model the Oxygen line in the Earthâs atmosphere (background feature). The best fit powerlaw index was 1.82+/-0.12, which indicates that the spectrum has significantly hardened within a  timespan of less than two months. The observed 0.3 - 10 keV NICER luminosity and flux were (3.95 +0.35 -0.23)e+43 ergs/s and (2.11 +0.16 -0.15)e-12 ergs/cm^2/s, respectively. In comparison to the previously observed values from Swift (6.9+/-0.4 e+42 ergs/cm^2/s, 3.6+/-0.2 e-13 ergs/s) and XMM (1.92+/-0.02 e+43 ergs/s, 1.0+/-0.1 e-12 ergs/cm^2/s), the latest 0.3-10 keV luminosity suggests an overall increasing trend.

The recent NICER data suggests that the X-ray corona may be actively forming now and presents a rare opportunity to capture the transition from an X-ray soft to an X-ray hard state. We encourage  multiwavelength observations, particularly in the radio. Further Swift (XRT+UVOT) and NICER observations are planned.

We report a correction to the position of FRB 20220912A previously observed at the Deep Synoptic Array (DSA-110, ATel #15693). After the observation of a burst from this source on 2022-10-18 UTC, we found an error in interferometric localizations of pulses from PSR B1933+16 observed on 2022-10-22 and 2022-10-24. This was caused by a fixed error in the absolute times used to phase visibilities derived from raw voltage data, and thus was not evident in the checks reported in ATel #15693.

The revised localization for FRB 20220912A is

23h09h04.9s +48d42m25.4s (J2000).

We report barely visible detection of a radio burst (S/N =5.1) from the recently discovered fast radio burst FRB20220912A (ATel #15679) in October 2022 daily archived data with the Big Scanning Antenna (BSA) at 111 MHz of the Pushchino Radio Astronomy Observatory. Observations were carried out with a 2.5 MHz bandwidth, ~415 kHz channel width and 100 ms sampling time. The coordinates used for the observations were RA (J2000): 23h09h05.49s +48d42m25.6s (J2000) (ATel #15693).  Detection algorithm included convolution of observations with matched template (decaying exponent) of width 0.6 s (1/e) for improvement of signal-to-noise ratio (V. A. Fedorova, A. E. Rodin). Pulse broadening @ DM=220 pc/cm^3 and bandwidth 415 kHz is 0.565 s. Width of the detected impulse convolved with template 1.49 s. After reduction for the broadening and template original pulse width estimate = 325 ms.

The burst was detected on October 18th 2022 at 18:48:15.53 UTC (Topocentric TOA @ freq=109.2 MHz) and had fluence 932 Jy ms. The fluence estimate takes into account the beam attenuation factor 0.28 due to detection on the side of the main diagram. The error margin for the fluence is about 15%. 
Trial dispersion measure was from 0 to 1000 pc/cm^3 with step 20. The best fit DM obtained is 220 +- 10 pc/cm^3.

The spectrum shows a redward slope due to high extinction of Milky Way dust. Below 8000 Angstrom the spectrum is dominated by the synchrotron emission from the GRB afterglow. Above 8000 Angstrom, however, broad spectral features are clearly visible that are probably due to the radiation from the emerging supernova ejecta. 
 
According to the SuperNova IDentification Tool (SNID, Blondin and Tonry 2007, Ap.J., 666, 1024), the best-matching template is that of the broad-lined Ic SN 2010bh at +1.2 days after maximum light. The redshift of the best-matching template is z ~ 0.149 +/- 0.04, which matches the reported redshift of the host galaxy, z = 0.151 (de Ugarte Postigo et al. GCN Circular #32648).

Triggered by the recent activities of SGR 1935+2154 in radio and X-ray bands (atel 15681,15682,15686,15690,15697,15698), the radio observations using Yunnan 40 meter radio telescope detected a radio burst from SGR 1935+2154 at MJD 59873.41789169 (10:01:45.84215 21th October 2022 UT) during a 9-hour observation session from 07 to 16 UT.  
 
The detection was made around the S-band central frequency of 2.245 GHz with the bandwidth of 110 MHz. We recorded the data with ROACH2 based system and the software package BEAR was used in burst signal searching. The candidate plot is available at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HuangYuxiang1/SGR-J1935-2154_Sband/main/sgr_burst.png. Our detection significance is approximately 20-$\sigma$. The estimated flux and fluence of the burst are approximately 20 Jy and 15 Jy ms, respectively. The best estimation of DM is 313 pc cm^{-3}, which is significantly lower than the previously reported values (Atel 13681,13684,15681) and may be resulted from the frequency or temporal evolution of the emission properties."

We report the Insight-HXMT observations on both the prompt emission and the afterglow of the record-breaking GRB 221009A (GCN 32632, ATel #15650).  
 
Insight-HXMT is mainly composed of three X-ray telescopes: the High Energy X-ray telescope (HE, Liu et al. 2022, SCPMA, 63, 249503), the Medium Energy X-ray telescope (ME, Cao et al. 2022, SCPMA, 63, 249504) and the Low Energy X-ray telescope (LE, Chen et al. 2022, SCPMA, 63, 249505). As a subsystem of the HE, the Anti-coincidence Detector (ACD, Liu et al. 2022, SCPMA, 63, 249503) is composed of 18 detector units with large-area plastic scintillators, which are primarily sensitive to the charged particles and used as particle veto for the main detector (NaI/CsI) of HE. There are also three Particle Monitor (PM) detectors around the HE, which are mainly used to monitor particle flux in the orbit to indicate whether the satellite is in the SAA area and thus the telescopes should be turned on and off accordingly.  
 
In principle, all these detectors mentioned above could measure gamma-rays (with different efficiency though) which could penetrate the shielding material or structures of the satellite, especially the CsI of HE (Zhang et al. 2022 SCPMA, 63, 249502) which has been used to monitor gamma-ray bursts routinely. The Insight-HXMT trigger time given by the ground search of CsI light curve is 2022-10-09T13:17:00.050 (T0, ATel #15660).  
 
Although some detectors (e.g. ACD and PM) have very low detection efficiency to gamma-rays, GRB 221009A is so bright that all detectors mentioned above recorded the prompt emission. 
However, there are some data gaps in HE, ME and ACD during the most bright part of the burst as they all went into SAA mode (i.e. turned off) which was triggered by the large count rate of PM. 
Fortunately, the lightcurves of LE and PM are well recovered or recorded for the peaks of main burst (T0+200s to T0+300s).  
 
With all these detectors, Insight-HXMT has observed the full history of the prompt emission of GRB 221009A.  
Please note that the lightcurves of HE, ME LE, ACD and PM are scaled for clarity.  
The spectral and timing analyses of the prompt emission are ongoing and will be reported. The prompt emission measured by Insight-HXMT: http://twiki.ihep.ac.cn/pub/HXMT/GRBList/GRB221009A_mainemission.png    
 
Moreover, Insight-HXMT also made observations on the afterglow phase of GRB 221009A, which include one scan observation from T0+10 ks to T0+30 ks and 20 pointing observations from T0+70 ks to T0+309 ks.  
 
From a preliminary analysis, the 1.5-10 keV spectra of these observations are well fitted by an absorbed power law with a photon index of ~2.5 and a column density of ~1.0&times1022 cm-2. The unabsorbed flux in 1.5-10 keV band declined from 1.0&times10-8 (2&times10-10) at T0+11006 s to 3.4&times10-11 (2&times10-11) erg/s/cm-2 at T0+253790.11 s, following a power law with an index ~-1.66. The data above can be found at http://hxmten.ihep.ac.cn/grb/735.jhtml   
 
Combining the observations of prompt emission and afterglow, the Insight-HXMT light curve of the full burst of GRB 221009A could be found at: http://twiki.ihep.ac.cn/pub/HXMT/GRBList/GRB221009A_afterglow.png   . 
The flux (in 0.25-3 MeV) for prompt emission is derived from HE CsI data, while the flux (in 1.5-10 keV) of afterglow is from LE data. All these results are preliminary. 
 
In summary, Insight-HXMT have made a comprehensive observation of GRB 221009A from the very beginning of the burst to the mid-late afterglow in the X-ray and gamma-ray range, providing an important and unique data set to characterize this historical burst."

The MAXI/GSC nova alert system triggered on a bright uncatalogued X-ray transient source at 2022-10-17T05:39:31 UT (GCN #32777). The inferred location of the transient from MAXI/GSC observations was RA/Dec(J2000) = (116.859, 39.409) = (07:47:26, +39:24:32) with a statistical 90% C.L. elliptical error region with long and short radii of 0.45 deg and 0.4 deg, respectively (GCN #32777). The averaged X-ray flux obtained from MAXI/GSC observations was 109 +- 30 mCrab (1-sigma error) in the 4.0-10.0 keV energy band (GCN #32777). Global MASTER-Net follow-up optical observations from the MASTER-OAFA robotic telescope set an upper limit of up to 17.2 mag on the transient source (GCN #32779). MAXI GRB221017 was also detected by INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), Konus-Wind, and Mars-Odyssey (HEND) observations (GCN #32787). The location of the source was triangulated using INTEGRAL (SPI-ACS), Konus-Wind, and Mars-Odyssey (HEND) observations to obtain a preliminary 3-sigma error box which reduced the area of the MAXI/GSC error box (GCN #32787).  
 
Swift/XRT observations of GRB 221017A were performed in Photon Counting (PC) mode (ObsID: 00021529002) between 2022-10-19 12:19:02 UT and 2022-10-19 20:23:59 UT, for a net exposure time of about 1.9 ks. Swift/XRT follow-up observations of GRB 221017A could not be scheduled earlier owing to Swift Moon observing constraint until 2022-10-19 morning hours. Two uncatalogued X-ray sources 6.8' and 8.0' away from the MAXI position have been detected in preliminary analysis of Swift/XRT observations at the following locations:

The uncatalogued X-ray sources lie within the MAXI/GSC localization error box (GCN #32777) and towards the periphery of the IPN triangulation map (GCN #32787). The inferred locations of the uncatalogued X-ray sources superposed on the MAXI/GSC error box and IPN triangulation map are available at the link. However, confirmation is required whether any of these uncatalogued X-ray sources are related to GRB 221017A.

IceCube has performed a search for track-like muon neutrino events arriving from the direction of SGR 1935+2154 (GCN Circular 32675 (INTEGRAL);  32796 (AGILE); ATel #15667, #15672, #15697, #15698) in a time range of 9 days beginning prior to the initial trigger reported by INTEGRAL (2022-10-09 21:28:25.8 UTC to 2022-10-18  21:28:25.8 UTC) during which IceCube was collecting good quality data. Eight muon track-like events are found coincident with the position of SGR 1935+2154 during this time period. We find that these data are consistent with atmospheric background expectations, with a p-value of 0.05. We accordingly derive a time-integrated muon-neutrino flux upper limit for this source of E^2 dN/ dE = 5.2 x 10^-2 GeV cm^-2 at 90% CL, under the assumption of an E^-2 power law. 90% of events IceCube would detect from a source at this declination with an E^-2 spectrum have energies in the approximate energy range between 800 GeV and 850 TeV.

SGR J1935+2154 has been in an active phase since early October 2022.  
Since 2022-10-13 04:51:43 UT, Insight-HXMT has been observing 
SGR J1935+2154 under a public ToO. 
Using different time resolutions (5, 10, 20, and 40 ms), we searched the data of Insight-HXMT/HE, ME, and LE 
(1-10keV/LE,10-30keV/ME, and 30-250 keV/HE_NaI). 
Assuming that bursts were separated at least by 1 s, Insight-HXMT detected over 200 bursts 
during the first two-day observation. 
The light curves show these bursts are typical magnetar short bursts. 
A burst forest of more than 60 bursts was detected from 2022-10-14T16:53 to 2022-10-14T17:41, 
which has also been reported by NICER and Nustar in atel #15690. 
 
We note that Insight-HXMT was pointed to SGR J1935+2154, but unfortunately blocked by the earth during the 
bright radio burst detected by CHIME (atel #15681) and GBT (atel #15697) from SGR J1935+2154 and the associated bright X-ray burst 
detected by GECAM and HEBS (atel #15682) and Konus-Wind (atel #15686). 
 
We caution that significant data saturation may exist and is not corrected in the standard Insight-HXMT data products, 
since Insight-HXMT was not designed to handle very high counting rates. 
We thus caution users of these data products be aware of these effects. 
 
This result is preliminary, and additional analysis of Insight-HXMT data is in progress. Insight-HXMT has been 
continuously observing SGR J1935+2154 since then. Any further information on Insight-HXMT observations on 
SGR J1935+2154 can be obtained by writing to Dr. C.K. Li (lick@ihep.ac.cn).

Triggered by recent X-ray activity (GCN #32675, ATel #15667, #15672), we observed SGR 1935+2154 with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) on 2022 Oct 14. During a C-Band session, we detected at least 5 bursts with high signal to noise ratio. All these bursts were detected within a time span of 1.5 seconds, i.e., well within one rotation of the magnetar, but over a range of phases. Throughout the entire duration of the two brightest bursts, the receiver system is clearly strongly saturated. 
 
The two brightest bursts occurred around 2022-10-14T19:21:39.1 UTC (topocentric, infinite frequency arrival time), consistent with the reported trigger time of a short (about 250 ms wide) bright X-ray burst detected by GECAM-B and GECAM-C (ATEL #15682). The CHIME/FRB burst at 600 MHz is consistent with any of these bursts within the arrival time precision reported in ATel #15681.  
 
Most bursts cover the entire 4.2-5.6 GHz band, representing the highest-frequency radio detections of SGR 1935+2154 to date. The magnetar thus emits over more than a factor 10 in radio bandwidth, from CHIME/FRB at 400 MHz to our detections up to 5.6 GHz. Most bursts also exhibit fine temporal substructures. 
 
We will report on the fluence of the two brightest bursts, and hence the burst radio spectrum, once we quantify the saturation response of the receiver system. Further analysis of the bursts is also underway, as is continued monitoring. 
 
We thank the Green Bank Observatory and staff for the prompt scheduling of our triggered observations and their support."

We report the detection of a radio burst from the newly discovered repeater 
FRB20220912A (ATel #15679) with the Medicina Northern Cross (MNC) radio 
telescope at 408 MHz. Observations were carried out with a 16 MHz bandwidth, 
~14.5 kHz channel width and ~138 us sampling time. The MNC monitored FRB20220912A 
for 3 days, ~43 mins per day with similar starting times given by the transit 
of the source. The coordinates used for the observations were RA (J2000): 
342.29 deg, Dec (J2000): +48.70 deg. 
 
The burst was detected on October 16th 2022 at 20:28:14 UTC (Barycentric 
Time of Arrival) and has ~65 Jy ms fluence and a 4.5 ms width. The fluence 
estimate takes into account the beam attenuation factor due to a off-centered 
detection (~20% at the burst time of arrival). The search was performed 
using the SPANDAK pipeline (Gajjar et al. 2018) spanning a DM range between 
0 and 1000 pc/cm3 with Signal to Noise Ratio > 7. The best fit DM obtained 
from this blind search was 218.9 +- 0.8 pc/cm3, consistent with the one

We report the detection and interferometric localization of FRB 20220912A with the Deep Synoptic Array (DSA-110). A single burst was detected at 2022-10-18 05:20:48.395 UTC (arrival time at 1530 MHz) with a detection S/N of 12.2 and a detected dispersion measure (DM) of 228.3 pc/cm^3. The burst arrival time and DM were produced by the real-time detection pipeline and will be subject to offline optimization. A preliminary inspection of the data suggests complex structure in the dedispersed dynamic spectrum, and the data are consistent with the reported DM of FRB 20220912A (ATEL #15679, ATEL #15691).

The DSA-110 is a radio interferometer purpose-built for fast radio burst (FRB) detection and localization. The array is located at Caltech's Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) in California, USA.  The array is currently comprised of 48x4.65-m dishes evenly spaced on the east-west arm of a Tee, which continuously search coherently beamformed data for FRBs in a band between 1280-1530MHz. If an event is detected, raw voltage data from 15x4.65-m ""outrigger"" antennas are dumped to allow for interferometric localization.

DSA-110 is a transit instrument with an approximately 10 sqdeg field-of-view. The dishes were pointed at the declination of FRB 20220912A after (ATEL #15679). The burst was detected in 55 min of exposure over the 21-min transit of the source. At boresight, the search SEFD is approximately 140 Jy.

Our best-fit preliminary localization for FRB 20220912A is

23h09h05.49s +48d42m25.6s (J2000)

The reported localization is derived from voltage data preserved at the 48 core antennas on the east-west arm and the 15 outrigger antennas, and ultimately calibrated with reference to several tens of >50mJy compact sources from the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (Condon et al., 1998, AJ, 115, 1693). The synthesized beam size was 29""x14"" at a position angle of 85 degrees, and the image S/N was 16. We verified the absolute astrometric calibration by imaging the VLBI calibrators J2258+4937 (separated by 2 degrees from FRB 20220912A) and J2325+4806 (separated by 2.8 degrees from FRB 20220912A), and recovered their positions at offsets of 0.7"" and 0.4"" respectively. Pending a formal analysis of our localization uncertainty, we consider the approximate 90% confidence localization ellipse to have semi-axes of 2"" in RA and 1"" in DEC, at a PA of 90 degrees.

The DSA-110 position is in agreement with the 90% uncertainty region reported by CHIME/FRB. There is a faint uncataloged object within the DSA-110 localization region in archival PanSTARRS g-band data. Further follow-up is ongoing and encouraged to assess this object and other galaxies near the DSA-110 localization region (ATEL #15679).

The DSA-110 is supported by the National Science Foundation Mid-Scale Innovations Program in Astronomical Sciences (MSIP) under grant AST-1836018. 
 
Data on the DSA-110 detection of FRB 20220912A will be made available below. Note the RA and Dec in the png are from the preliminary detection and not the localization analysis.

Following the report of high activity of FRB20220912A by the CHIME/FRB collaboration (ATEL #15679), observations of this target were carried out using the Stockert telescope, commencing on 15 October 2022.

Intensity data were recorded in L-Band at 1330 to 1430 MHz with dual linear polarizations using a time resolution of 218 microseconds and a spectral resolution of 586 kHz. The data was incoherently de-dispersed using a DM of 219.46 pc cm^-3 as determined by the CHIME/FRB collaboration. 
A total of 49 hours on source were accumulated until 17 October 2022. During this time, 11 bright pulses have been detected. A preliminary evaluation of the pulses with respect to peak flux density and fluence has been carried out and are provided in the table below. Calibration was performed using the calibrator noise source of the instrument.

The error margin for the peak flux density and fluence is about 20%. The Stockert telescope is a 25-m dish operated by the volunteer organization âAstropeiler Stockert e.V.â The instrument has a SEFD of ~ 380 Jy, and thus this observation likely samples only the brightest events of the overall burst population. Further observation with higher sensitivity instruments will allow more insight in the overall distribution. The high cadence of events might enable localization of the source.

The young core-collapse supernova SN 2022xkq (=DLT22r/ATLAS22binf) in NGC 1784, classified as a Type I/Ic event, has been observed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at 5.5 and 9.0 GHz on 15 Oct 2022 19:55-22:50 UT. No radio emission was detected to 3-sigma upper limits on the flux density of 0.07 mJy and 0.04 mJy at 5.5 GHz and 9.0 GHz, respectively. Adopting a mean host galaxy distance of ~25 Mpc from the NASA Extragalactic Database (NED) this implies an upper limit on the 5.5 GHz luminosity within 4 days of explosion of 5.2E+25 erg/sec/Hz. We would like to extend our thanks to the ATCA staff for enabling these observations.

Konus-Wind (KW) detected a short X-ray burst on 2022-10-14 in time interval from 19:21:39.205 UTC to 19:21:42.149 UTC. Corrected for the propagation from low-Earth orbit to Wind (~1.05 s), the burst arrival time is consistent with the detection time of a bright short X-ray burst from SGR 1935+2154, 
reported by GECAM and HEBS (Atel #15682), which, in turn, is consistent with the dedispersed topocentric time of a bright radio burst detected from SGR 1935+2154 by CHIME (Atel #15681). 
 
The event was detected by KW in the waiting mode and no detailed information on its temporal structure is available. The emission is seen in two instrument's energy bands: G1(20-80 keV) and G2 (80-320 keV), while no statistically significant signal is visible above 320 keV. 
A time-averaged spectrum of the burst can be described in the 20-1300 keV range by a power law with exponential cutoff model: dN/dE ~ (E^alpha)*exp(-E*(2+alpha)/Ep) with the peak energy Ep of (40 Â± 6) keV, which is slightly higher than a typical Ep of multiple bright SGR 1935+2154 bursts detected by KW recently (GCN Circ. 32768). We also note that the October 14 burst Ep is about twice as lower as the peak energy (~85 keV) measured by KW for the much radio-brighter event SGR/FRB200428 from the same magnetar (Ridnaia et al. 2021, NatAstr. 5, 372). From the KW detection, we estimate the total 20-500 keV fluence of the burst to (5.7 Â± 0.6)x10^-7 erg/cm2, about two times lower than that of SGR/FRB200428."

We used the RT-22 Simeiz radio telescope (Volvach et al., A&A 648, A27, 2021) to observe GRB221009A at 22.2 and 36.8 GHz. The observations were carried out on October 11th and 14th, 2022. The observations lasted about 3 hours at each band. The quasar 3C286 was used as the primary flux standard to calibrate the absolute flux scale. A radio source was significantly detected at the first epoch but not clearly detected in the second epoch:

Compared with previous observational results from RATAN-600 (ATel #15671) and other radio telescopes (ATel #15653, #15655, GCN Circ. #32757), our observations show that the radio counterpart of GRB221109A has entered an optically thin phase above 10 GHz 5 days after the burst, and the turnover frequency appears to have shifted to below 10 GHz. Any radio interferometer follow-up monitoring would be very critical for understanding the rapid evolution of the radio emission of this peculiar GRB as well as the pre-burst environment.

Both GECAM-B and HEBS (dubbed as GECAM-C) were triggered in-flight  
by a bright short X-ray burst at 2022-10-14T19:21:39.100 UTC (T0). 
The in-flight and ground localization given by both instruments  
are well consistent with SGR J1935+2154 within the error. 
 
We note that this burst is associated with a bright radio burst  
detected by CHIME (Atel #15681). The time lag between the radio and x-ray burst 
is about 8 s, which is consistent with the expected dispersion time from this SGR. 
This time lag also resembles the value of FRB200428. 
 
The alert data was promptly downlinked to the ground through  
the short message service of BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS).  
The time latency of the first BeiDou message is about T0+1 minute. 
According to the GECAM-B and GECAM-C light curves in about 20-100 keV,  
this burst mainly consists of a single pulse with a duration about 250 ms.  
 
Please note that all GECAM and HEBS results here are preliminary.  
Refined analysis is ongoing and will be report later.

Polarization degree (PD) < 11.1%

upper limits are derived with 99% C.L.

These results are preliminary. The IXPE Collaboration will report the final results in a forthcoming publication.

The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer, commonly known as IXPE is a space observatory with three identical telescopes designed to measure the polarization of cosmic X-rays. X-ray polarimetry enabled by IXPE can be performed in energy-, time-, and angle-resolved fashions. The observatory, which was launched on 9 December 2021, is an international collaboration between NASA and the Italian Space Agency (ASI)."

Following the reports of bursting activity from SGR 1935+2154 (ATel #15667, GCN 32698, 32706, 32708), we observed the source with the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) on 2022 October 12 starting at 17:32:40 UTC for a total exposure time of 8.5 ks spanning 15.8 hours.

Through preliminary analysis of these observations, we detect 112 burst candidates with significance higher than 7 sigma. This implies a burst rate of about 0.013 per second, an order of magnitude lower than what NICER recorded during the 2020 April burst storm from the source (Younes et al. 2020 ApJ, 904L, 21). The burst that reached the highest count rate is recorded at 17:43:11 (UTC); it has a duration of about 0.3 s and reaches a peak rate of 4.2e4 counts/s at 16 ms resolution. Assuming a blackbody model with a temperature of 3 keV, this translates to a peak flux in the 1-10 keV range of about 8.0e-7 erg/cm^2/s.

We also extracted an X-ray spectrum of the persistent emission from the source, after filtering out the burst intervals. The resulting spectrum is best fit with an absorbed blackbody plus a power-law model in the 1-8 keV range. Interstellar absorption is taken into account using the 'tbabs' model with ISM abundances (Wilms et al. 2000; ApJ, 542, 914) and is fixed to N_H = 2.4e22 cm^-2. We find a best fit blackbody temperature kT = 0.70 +/- 0.03 keV and a power-law with a photon index of Gamma=1.0+/-0.2. The unabsorbed 0.5 - 10 keV flux of the source is 2.6 +/- 0.1 x10^-11 ergs/cm^2/s, which is an order of magnitude higher than the source quiescent flux level (e.g., Younes et al. 2020 ApJ, 904L, 21Y, Borghese et al. 2022, MNRAS, 516, 602B). These properties indicate that SGR 1935+2154 is undergoing yet another prolific outburst.

Further NICER observations are planned and we encourage multiwavelength observations, especially with radio facilities. The NICER schedule can be found at https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/nicer/schedule/nicer_sts_current.html.

The X-ray and optical transient Swift J1913.1+1946 (ATel #15650; GCN #32632) is possibly associated with a gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A (Fermi GBM alert, GCN #32635, #32636). This bright transient has been observed by numerous instruments in optical, X-ray and gamma-ray bands (ATel #15651, #15653, #15655, #15656, #15660, #15661, #15662, #15663, #15664, #15665; GCN #32634 - #32671, #32676 - #32679, #32683 - #32686, #32688, #32690 - #32695 and counting). Tentative redshift from the observation of the afterglow emission is z=0.151 (GCN #32648, #32686). In case the GRB association is true, this event produced the most energetic GRB photon ever seen by Fermi LAT (ATel #15656), that of 99 GeV. Moreover, the same transient was detected by LHAASO during 2000 sec after the GRB trigger with photons up to 18 TeV, highest energies ever detected from a GRB (GCN #32677).

In a follow-up analysis of Carpet-2 data, we found an air shower consistent with being caused by a photon of 251 TeV energy, giving zero hits in the 175 m2 muon detector. This event was detected at 14:32:35 UT, that is 1338 sec after the SWIFT trigger and 4536 sec after the GBM trigger. The reconstructed arrival direction is RA=289.51 deg, DEC=18.44 deg, that is 1.78 deg from the transient direction, well within the Carpet-2 angular resolution of 4.7 deg (90% CL).

Such a high-energy muonless, that is photon-like, shower is a rare event. For the declination of the transient, from a given direction within the 90% CL angular resolution, one expects one background photon-like shower of this energy to arrive in 428 days, which corresponds to the Poisson probability of a random coincidence in 4536 seconds of 1.2*10-4, that is to the 3.8 sigma pre-trial significance. We note that it is not trivial to estimate the significance correctly in an a posteriori search. More details will be published after further elaborated analysis.

High-energy photons attenuate through production of electron-positron pairs on cosmic background radiation, and 250-TeV photons (as well as 18-TeV photons detected by LHAASO) cannot reach us from the assumed GRB redshift z=0.151 unless unconventional particle physics is involved. Examples are axion-like particles (e.g. Csaki et al. 2003, de Angelis et al. 2007, review in Troitsky 2017) or Lorentz-invariance violation (e.g. Kifune 1999, review in Martinez-Huerta et al. 2020). However, given the low Galactic latitude, b=4 deg, of the event, an association of high-energy photons with a Galactic transient remains a possible explanation.

Carpet-2 is an air-shower array at Baksan Neutrino Observatory of the Institute for Nuclear Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences, capable of detecting cosmic gamma rays above 100 TeV (see e.g. Dzhappuev et al. (2020) for a recent description and further references)."

NuSTAR began a Target of Opportunity observation of GRB 221009A (GCN #32632) on October 11, 2022 at 03:10:07 UTC, approximately 38 hours after the Fermi-GBM Trigger (GCN #32642), with an exposure of 23.4 ks (PIs Racusin and Margutti).

The 3-79 keV spectrum is well fit by a power law with a photon index of Gamma= 1.81 +/- 0.01, which is consistent with the value inferred from Swift-XRT observations acquired during the same time window.  The corresponding unabsorbed flux is (3.37 +/- 0.02) e-10 erg/cm2/s (3-79 keV). Over the NuSTAR observation, the source X-ray flux declines by about 30%. However, preliminary analysis does not indicate a significant evolution of the 10-20 keV / 3-6 keV hardness ratio.

These findings are consistent with the hard X-ray afterglow contemporaneously observed by INTEGRAL JEM-X and ISGRI (GCN Circ #32691) and support an absorbed simple power-law spectrum extending from soft X-ray to hard X-ray energies.

Three additional NuSTAR monitoring observations are planned and are anticipated to occur on October 15th, 20th, and November 2nd.  We thank the NuSTAR SOC for promptly implementing these observations."

We report on initial NICER observations of the exceptionally bright GRB 221009A, at a redshift of 0.1505 (GCN #32648, #32686) and observed from radio to TeV energies (GCNs #32632, #32635, #32636, #32641, #32658, #32661, #32668, #32677, and ATels #15653, #15655, #15656, #15660, #15661).  
NICER observed GRB 221009A intermittently from 2022 Oct 9 17:11 to Oct 11 00:12 UT, or 14.7 ksec to 126 ksec after the Fermi/GBM trigger time (GCN #32636). During this period, NICER made 12 observations with exposure times ranging from 40 to 400 sec each. The initial count rate registered with NICER is 1400 counts/s which declined to about 38 counts/s at the time of the last observation reported here. From a preliminary analysis, we find that the decline follows a power law with an index of -1.6. The 1-10 keV spectrum of each observation is well reproduced by an absorbed power-law model with a spectral index of about 2.0. We used the tbabs model with wilms abundance in XSPEC (Wilms, Allen & McCray 2000) for an assumed Galactic absorption of 5.4 x 1021 cm-2 (Willingale et al. 2013; GCN #32651). The average column density of these observations with the ztbabs model is 1.1 x 1022 cm-2 at a redshift of 0.151 (GCN #32648). The absorbed (unabsorbed) flux in the 0.3 - 10 keV band declined from 6.1 x 10-9 (1.3 x 10-8) to 1.8 x 10-10 (3.3 x 10-10) erg/sec/cm2.  
 
NICER initially received notification of the GRB through OHMAN (On-orbit Hookup of MAXI and NICER) at 14:10:57 UT on Oct 9, but poor visibility delayed a prompt follow-up.  OHMAN is software on an International Space Station laptop computer that provides a new automated triggering capability, monitoring live MAXI data and communicating new transient alerts to NICER for follow-up within minutes, visibility permitting. NICER is continuing to monitor GRB 221009A. Detailed temporal and spectral analysis is ongoing.

Following the detection of the record-breaking GRB221009A by Swift/BAT (GCN #32632,#32635), Fermi/GBM (GCN #32636), INTEGRAL/SPI-ACS (GCN #32660), we have performed INTEGRAL pointed observations of the GRB221009A location.  
INTEGRAL pointed observation lasted from 2022-10-10T14:31:40 (T0 + 25.2 hours, where T0 is 2022-10-09T13:17:00) to 2022-10-11T03:18:20 (T0 + 38.0 hours) with a total exposure time of 30.2 ks (for ISGRI). 
In the complete observation, the source is clearly detected in JEM-X1, JEM-X2 (3-30 keV), and ISGRI (28 - 80 keV), with S/N of 27.8, 27.3, 15.0 respectively. 
The joint JEM-X and ISGRI spectra can be satisfactorily modeled between 3 and 80 keV with a single powerlaw of slope 2.15 Â± -0.07 (90% confidence) with a flux of 4.4e-10 Â± -2.1e-11 erg/cm2/s (3 - 80 keV). 
This might indicate a single spectral component spanning from from hard X-ray to Fermi/LAT (GCN #32658). 
Combination of bright Hard X-ray afterglow with gamma-ray emission was also found in GRB120711A (Martin-Carrillo et al. 2014 A&A 567, 84) and GRB130427A (Kouveliotou et al. 2013 ApJ 779L, 1K) 
- in fact GRB221009A appears rather similar to GRB120711A, but at 10 times smaller distance. 
 
Within the relatively short JEM-X not ISGRI lightcurves, we do not observe any evidence for flux decrease. 
 
Further INTEGRAL observations are scheduled between 2022-10-11 13:52:21 and 2022-10-13 00:58:26. These observations will overlap with the planned observation of IXPE (GCN #32690). 
We are grateful to the INTEGRAL Ground Segment team for quickly scheduling the observations.

The GRID detector onboard the AGILE satellite detected the bright emission classified as GRB 221009A or Swift J1913.1+1946 (z = 0.151, GCN #32648) , reported by Swift/BAT (GCN #32635) at T0 = 2022-10-09 13:16:59 (UTC), and detected by several facilities up to TeV energies (ATel #15653, #15655, #15656, #15660, #15661, GCN #32636, #32641, #32658, #32661, #32668, #32677).

Integrating from 2022-10-09 UT 13:16:59 (T0) to 2022-10-09 UT 14:16:59 (T0 + 1h), a preliminary multi-source likelihood analysis yields a detection with a significance of 42 sigma and a gamma-ray flux F(>100 MeV) = (1.11 +/- 0.08) x 10^-3 photons/cm^2/s, by adopting a power-law model with a (standard reference) photon index value of -2.1 (GCN #32657). 
The angular position of the gamma-ray event, as detected by the AGILE/GRID, is: 
(l, b) =  (52.99, 4.26) +/- 0.17 deg (stat.) +/- 0.10 deg (syst.)

The AGILE-GRID count map in Galactic coordinates, related to this time-integration, can be found at http://www.agilescienceapp.it/notices/Swift_J1913_09oct_T0_1h_cts.png   , with the AGILE-GRID contour level (95% C.L., stat. only, green) and the nominal position of Swift J1913.1+1946 (black cross) as reported by Swift/BAT (ATel #15650).

Interestingly, AGILE-GRID found significant detections both below and above 400 MeV in the time interval between T0 and T0 + 1h. For 100 MeV < E < 400 MeV and E > 400 MeV, preliminary multi-source likelihood analyses found a detection with a significance of 32 sigma with a gamma-ray flux F(<400 MeV) = (7.8 +/- 0.7) x 10^-4 photons/cm^2/s, and a detection with a significance of 27 sigma with a gamma-ray flux F(>400 MeV) = (3.5 +/- 0.4) x 10^-4 photons/cm^2/s, respectively.

After the burst, integrating from T0 + 1h to T0 + 2h, we found a faint detection with a significance of 3.4 sigma and a gamma-ray flux F(>100 MeV) = (2 +/- 1) x 10^-5 photons/cm^2/s. Before the burst, integrating from T0 - 2h to T0, no gamma-ray signal was detected with a 2-sigma UL(>100 MeV) = 8.2 x 10^-6 photons/cm^2/s. Additional analysis of the AGILE data is in progress.

The AGILE-GRID detection was obtained while AGILE is observing in spinning mode, surveying a large fraction of the sky each day. The source can be monitored with the public mobile application ""AGILEScience"" developed by the AGILE Team, available for both Android and iOS devices."

 GRB 221009A consists of three parts in the light curve including a precusor around 180 seconds ahead, which is among the longest separation between the precursor and the main burst of a GRB. We note that this precusor is also visible in the GBM data. This GRB is so bright that there is a significant saturation effect (data loss) during bright parts of this GRB in the Insight-HXMT data. Further timing and spectral analysis of Insight-HXMT data is ongoing and will be reported later. 
 
All measurements above are made with the CsI detectors operating in the low gain mode with the energy range of about 200-3000 keV (deposited energy). Only gamma-rays with energy greater than about 200 keV can penetrate the spacecraft and leave signals in the CsI detectors installed inside of the telescope.  
 
Insight-HXMT is China's first X-ray astronomy satellite, which was funded jointly by the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). More information about it could be found at: http://www.hxmt.org."

AT2019teq/ZTF19accmaxo is a tidal disruption event (TDE) discovered by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) on 2019 October 20. It is one of the 30 TDEs selected by Phase I of ZTF (Hammerstein et al. 2022). Hereafter we use t to denote rest-frame days since its optical maximum (MJD 58794.3). 
 
 
From 2019 December 14 to 2020 May 7 (t = 34--167 days), AT2019teq was observed by the Swift/XRT. The combined XRT spectrum (25ks) was soft, and only detected above background up to 4.0 keV. We modeled the spectrum with tbabs*ztbabs*zashift*powerlaw, with the Galactic column density fixed at nH(0)=5.3e+20 cm^-2 and the redshift fixed at 0.0878. The best-fit model indicates a power-law index of Gamma = 3.52 + 0.53 -0.45 and an absorption at the host redshift of nH(z)=0.14 +0.09 -0.07 e+22 cm^-2. The observed 0.3--10 keV flux is 3.6 +/- 0.2 e-13 erg s^-1 cm^-2, corresponding to an isotropic equivalent luminosity of 6.9 +/- 0.4 e+42 erg/s. 
 
 
On 2022 September 8 (t = 952 days), AT2019teq was observed by XMM-Newton as part of GO (AO 21) program (P.I. Yao). The spectrum shows clear hardening, the source is detected above background up to 6.0 keV. We modeled the spectrum with tbabs*ztbabs*zashift*powerlaw, with the Galactic column density and the redshift fixed. The best-fit model indicates a power-law index of Gamma = 2.99 +/- 0.01 and an absorption at the host redshift of nH(z)=0.19 +/- 0.1 e+22 cm^-2. The observed 0.3--10 keV flux is 1.0 +/- 0.1 e-12 erg s^-1 cm^-2, corresponding to an isotropic equivalent luminosity of 1.92 +/- 0.02 e+43 erg/s. 
 
 
A late-time spectral hardening in a TDE might be caused by the delayed formation of a magnetically dominated corona. Clear detections have recently been reported in AT2018fyk (Wevers et al. 2021) and AT2021ehb (Yao et al. 2022). 
 
 
Given the X-ray spectral evolution and the brightening, we encourage multi-wavelength follow-up observations, particularly in the radio band to search for the presence of a jet/outflow.

We report updated observations of GRB 221009A which was detected by Swift (Kennea et al. GCN #32635), Fermi-GBM (Veres et al. GCN #32636, Lesage et al. GCN #32642), Fermi-LAT (Bissaldi et al. GCN #32637), and the IPN (Svinkin et al. GCN #32641).

Fermi-GBM triggered on October 10, 2022, at 13:16:59.99 UT (687014224/221009553), about 1 hour earlier with respect to the Swift trigger, which was reported as a new bright hard X-ray and optical transient and tentatively classified as Swift J1913.1+1946 (Dichiara et al., GCN 32632). Prompt GCN notices from GBM were not distributed due to problems with the real-time downlink from TDRS, therefore no automatic Fermi LAT GRB pipelines were triggered by the GBM event.

Using LAT events with E>100 MeV between T0+200 s and T0+800 s after the GBM trigger time, we find a LAT localization of RA = 288.28 deg, Dec = 19.49 deg (J2000), with a 90% containment radius of 0.03 degrees (statistical only). The LAT lightcurve shows a bright structured emission episode which is temporally coincident with the GBM main emission episode starting at T0+200s.

The 100 MeV - 1 GeV photon flux in the time interval 200-800 s after the GBM trigger is (6.2 +/- 0.4)e-03 ph/cm2/s. The estimated photon index above 100 MeV is -1.87 +/- 0.04. From a preliminary analysis, the LAT emission is extending for about 25ks post GBM trigger. The highest-energy photon is 99 GeV (with a probability of 99.2%) which is observed 240 seconds after the GBM trigger. This represents the highest GRB photon energy ever detected by Fermi-LAT (the previous record holder being a 95 GeV event from GRB 130427A).

The Fermi-LAT point of contact for this burst is Elisabetta Bissaldi (elisabetta.bissaldi@ba.infn.it).

The Fermi-LAT is a pair conversion telescope designed to cover the energy band from 20 MeV to greater than 300 GeV. It is the product of an international collaboration between NASA and DOE in the U.S. and many scientific institutions across France, Italy, Japan and Sweden."

After the detection of a bright radio counterpart to GRB221009A at 15.5 GHz was reported in ATel #15653/GCN 32653, we conducted follow-up observations with the Allen Telescope Array (ATA) at 1.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10 GHz. Observations were carried out simultaneously at 1.5 + 3, 4 + 6 and 8 + 10 GHz, with a 672 MHz bandwidth centered on each frequency, using a newly deployed wideband correlator (Farah et al., in prep.), at spectral and temporal resolution of 0.5MHz and 10s, respectively. The target field was observed for 1 hour per pair of frequencies. The primary flux standard 3c286 was used to calibrate the absolute flux scale and bandpass response of the array, and J1925+2106 was used to calibrate the time dependent complex gains. Data flagging was performed with AOFlagger (Offringa+2012) while calibration and imaging were performed using standard techniques in CASA (McMullin+2007).

We clearly detect an unresolved radio source at a position consistent with the one reported in ATel #15650 at 3, 6, 8, and 10 GHz. Preliminary flux densities at 3, 6, 8, and 10 GHz are reported below, and include a 10% absolute flux scale uncertainty in addition to the statistical error from the fit. Observations conducted at 4 GHz were severely corrupted by radio frequency interference and were not processed. Our observations indicate that the radio counterpart to GRB221009A/Swift J1913.1+1946 is self-absorbed below around 10 GHz, although there is apparently significant flux density evolution between observing epochs.

The Allen Telescope Array is a 42-element radio interferometer located at the Hat Creek Radio Observatory in Northern California. The facility is fully operated by the SETI Institute."

The flux standard 3c286 was used to calibrate the bandpass response and flux scale of the AMI-LA and J1925+2106 was used as an interleaved complex gain calibrator.

We detect a bright unresolved source at a position consistent with the one reported in ATel #15650 at a (preliminary) flux density of 39 +/- 2 mJy (including both a statistical uncertainty and a 5% absolute flux scale uncertainty). There is no significant emission at this position in either the VLA Sky Survey (VLASS; Lacy+2020) or the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS; Condon+1998), and so we identify this new source as the radio counterpart to GRB221009A/Swift J1913.1+1946. Further observations are planned.

We thank the staff at the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory for carrying out these observations and operating the AMI-LA."

We report on the detection of an X-ray transient serendipitously discovered in a Swift/XRT observation of NGC7793P13 (obsID 00031791173) on 2022-09-25. The source has a position of RA=359.45788, Dec=-32.59104 (=23 57 49.89, 32 35 27.8) with an error radius 3.0'' (90% confidence) and a 0.3--10 keV count rate of 0.052+/-0.008 cts/s. The source position is consistent with the nucleus of NGC 7793 at 3.8 Mpc.

The XRT spectrum is not well constrained, nevertheless it can be described by an absorbed power-law model with NH<3x10^21 cm^-2 and Gamma=1.5^+0.8_-0.4. The observed 0.3--10 keV flux is 2.2x10^-12 erg/cm^2/s, which corresponds to a luminosity of 3.8x10^39 erg/s assuming a distance of 3.8 Mpc to NGC 7793. Previous to this detection, NGC 7793 was observed with Swift on 2022-09-11 when the source was not detected, however a Chandra source with a flux 3 orders of magnitude lower than seen has been reported at the position of the Swift/XRT source. While this appears to be a nuclear transient, the luminosity does not preclude a transient ULX. Further observations with other X-ray observatories are encouraged to determine the nature of this source."

Subjects: X-ray, Tidal Disruption Event

The nuclear transient AT2022exr/ZTF22aadgefj was first detected by ATLAS (Tonry et al., 2022) and later classified as a TDE due to its persistent blue optical colors, UV detection, and characteristic TDE emission features in follow-up optical spectra (Hammerstein et al., 2022). However, late time ZTF data show a second peak in the optical, unlike classical TDE, but similar to the nuclear transient AT2019avd (Malyali et al., 2021). X-rays were not detected during the two optical peaks.

On 22 August 2022 (MJD 58912), Swift/XRT detected the source with a background-corrected count rate of 5.4 +/- 0.5 x10^(-2) ct/s (0.3-10.0 keV). The spectrum is soft, with essentially all counts below 1keV. We fit the spectrum containing 94 counts with a thermal disk model, assuming Galactic absorption (N_H ~ 5.8x10^20 cm^-2), and the reported redshift z = 0. 096 (TBabs*zashift*diskbb, in XSPEC), and using cash statistics. The best-fitting temperature is 0.11 +/- 0.01 keV. The 0.3-10 keV observed (unabsorbed) flux is 1.8 +/- 0.2 x 10^-12 (3.7 +/- 0.4 x 10^-12) erg/cm^2/s, which at the luminosity distance of the source (445 Mpc) represents an unabsorbed luminosity of 8.7x10^43 erg/s. This value is typical for X-ray TDEs. Assuming the same spectrum, we measured a 3 sigma upper flux limit of 2.2x10^-13 erg/cm^2/s (6.6x10^-3 ct/s) on 12 August 2022 (MJD 59802). This represents a factor of at least 10 increase in ten days.

This X-ray detection occurred ~140 days after the first optical peak and ~25 days after the second one. 
This adds AT2022exr to the growing list of optically-selected nuclear transients with delayed X-ray brightening. We have requested for additional Swift and NICER monitoring. Follow-up is encouraged especially in the radio band.

Optical transient 
AT2022prv (PS22gjh) in the galaxy IC 1132 was observed at Lick 
Observatory on 2022 July 28 and classified as SN II or LBV outburst 
having absolute magnitude of -15.2 (ATEL #15530). We performed 
additional observations of this transient on August 1 and 3 using 
Russian 6-m telescope and SCORPIO multi-mode focal reducer (Afanasiev 
V.L. & Moiseev A.V., 2005, Astron. Letters, V.31, p.194). The 
comparison star for BV(RI)c photometry was the SDSS standard in the 
field of IC 1132 with the position ra=235.0172, dec=20.6939. Its SDSS 
magnitudes were transformed into the Vega BV(RI)c magnitudes: B=16.37, 
V=15.54, Rc=15.08, Ic=14.67. UT date of observations, V magnitudes, 
B-V, V-R and R-I color indices of AT2022prv were as follows:

2022 
Aug 3.86       |     16.77   | -0.17 | +0.15  | -0.03

Our 
observations show continuous increase of the star brightness to the 
level 2 magnitudes above the Lick data. Probably the explosion did 
not reach its maximum on Aug 3. On this date, the transient reached 
absolute V magnitude Mv= -17.58 ± 0.15 mag. Its classification as SN 
II is now undeniable.

We 
have taken the blue spectrum of AT2022prv on 2022 Aug 1.90 UT 
(spectral range 3760-5355 Å, spectral resolution of 5.7 Å), another 
blue spectrum on 2022 Aug 3.89 UT (3670-5360 Å, 5.7 Å) and the red 
spectrum on Aug 3.88 UT (5629-7338 Å, 5.0 Å). Spectra show hot blue 
continuum with broad emission features. The strongest double-peak 
feature is He II 4686 Å line merged with Bowen C III + N III blend. 
Its equivalent width EW = -40 Å, and FWZI is of about 11000 km/s. 
All the lines consist of a narrow central peak and very wide 
intensive wings. FWHM of central peak of hydrogen lines was about 400 
km/s on Aug 1 but expanded to 900 km/s on Aug 3. While FWZI of 
hydrogen lines are between 8500 and 10200 km/s. This supernova is very 
similar to the supernova 1998S in NGC 3877 (Q.-Z. Liu, J.-Y. Hu, 
H.-R. Hang et al., 2000, Astron. Astrophys. Suppl. Ser. 144, p.219), 
because it also has Wolf-Rayet star features in the pre-maximum 
spectrum, and it has narrow emission components superposed on a broad 
component same as the rare IIn type class of supernovae. The 
structure of the emission lines suggests the explosion of the SN in 
hydrogen-rich environment.

AT2021ehb/ZTF21aanxhjv is a tidal disruption event (TDE) identified by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) on 1 March 2022 (Gezari et al 2021, TNS AstroNote 103). Similar to many previous TDEs the X-rays started to rise post optical peak. Yao et al. (2022) have recently performed a detailed multiwavelength study using data acquired between March 2021 and May 2022. In short, in X-rays, the source rose by three orders of magnitude over a timespan of 300 days after which it suddenly dropped by an order of magnitude within 3 days. Over this 300 day time the source first went from soft to hard and the sudden flux drop was accompanied by an X-ray softening.

New NICER X-ray observations were taken on 20 July 2022, roughly 180 days after the X-ray drop (and 507 days post optical discovery). Additional Swift XRT exposures have been taken throughout July 2022. Compared with the observations in January-April 2022, AT2021ehb has become harder and the observed 0.3-10 keV flux has increased by a factor of ~3 to (1.9 -0.1 +0.2) E-12 erg/cm^2/s. We modeled this new NICER 0.3-4.0 keV spectrum with tbabs*zashift*simpl(diskbb) model in XSPEC and find the best-fit power-law index, the Compton scattering fraction, and the disk temperature to be 2.5+-0.3, 0.35(+0.18,-0.10), and 0.14+-0.02 keV, respectively. For comparison these values on 25 January 2022 (shortly after the X-ray softening accompanied by flux drop) were 2.92+-0.15, 0.16+-0.03, and 0.125+-0.008, respectively. These most recent parameters indicate that the corona is getting gradually energized (see Fig. 18 of Yao et al. 2022 for comparison). This behavior of soft-->hard-->soft-->hard X-ray spectral change has never been seen in a TDE before. We encourage follow-up especially in the X-ray and radio band to search for strong relativistic iron lines and jet emission.

Swift and NICER are planning to continue to monitor AT2021ehb with additional ToO and DDT observations. The Swift schedule of AT2021ehb can be found here: https://www.swift.psu.edu/operations/obsSchedule.php?t=14217.

SN2018ivc was discovered by the DLT40 survey in the nearby galaxy NGC1068 on 24.074-11-2018 (MJD 58446.074), and reported in ATel #12239. We report a coincidental radio detection of SN2018ivc discovered when working on Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) A-array data of NGC 1068 observed on 20.06-01-2021 (MJD 59234.06). We also detected the source on 24.64-03-2022 (MJD 59662.64) with the e-MERLIN array.

The source position from our high sensitivity e-MERLIN data is RA (J2000) = 02:42:41.280 +/- 0.002 and Dec (J2000) = -00:00:31.996 +/- 0.026. The position matches that of SN2018ivc (ATel #12239). Our archival e-MERLIN data from 15.02-01-2018 (MJD 58133.02) does not show the source, confirming its transient nature. To our knowledge, this is the first radio detection of SN2018ivc. We measured a total flux of 9.1 +/- 0.9 mJy and 8.7 +/- 1.3 mJy at 6.5 GHz with the VLA (synthesized beam = 0.29"" x 0.23"", P.A. = 137.34 deg) and at 6.3 GHz with e-MERLIN (synthesized beam = 0.10"" x 0.03"", P.A. = 23.21 deg), respectively. Ongoing monitoring observations are underway. We thank the VLA and e-MERLIN schedulers for making these observations.

As part of a follow-up Directorâs Discretionary program (GO-17228), we acquired a half orbit of WFC3 IR F110W imaging, a half orbit of WFC3 IR F160W imaging, as well as five orbits of G102 grism spectroscopy on July 11, 2022 UT. A full orbit of WFC3 UVIS F814W imaging was also attempted, but a guide star was never acquired successfully during the observations.  
 
We created difference images by subtracting archival CLASH imaging from the newly acquired F110W and F160W imaging. Within an 0.3-arcsecond radius aperture centered at the position of PSN 2022nmr, we measure an apparent magnitude of 28.1+-1.1 mag AB (detection with significance of only one sigma) in the F110W imaging, and 26.2+-0.4 mag AB (with 2.4 sigma significance) from the F160W imaging. We will continue to monitor the field during three upcoming visits planned through the middle of August, and plan to obtain F140W and F160W during the latter two visits for improved red sensitivity. Analysis of the grism data is ongoing."

We report on initial NICER observations of GRB 220706A (GCN #32329) carried out on 2022 July 7. The observations were carried out in two parts.  
The first epoch began at 01:36 UT, approximately a half-day after the Swift/BAT trigger (GCN #32329), and ended at 03:34 UT, with ~1.5 ksec of exposure across two successive orbits of the International Space Station (ISS). The lightcurve shows a slow decay: the NICER-measured X-ray flux decreased from 8 x 10-13 to 6 x 10-13 erg/cm2/s in the 0.3-10 keV band. The emission overall was soft, with hardness ratio of 0.1 between the 0.3-2.0 and 2.0-10.0 keV bands. The second epoch was from 17:08 to 22:09 UT (~1 day after the Swift/BAT detection), with 3.4 ksec exposure in total. We found re-brightening of the afterglow: the NICER average flux during the second epoch was 6.5 x 10-12erg/cm2/s in 0.3-10 keV, with a hardness ratio of 0.6. The result suggests that the spectrum has significantly hardened compared with the first-epoch results, unlike typical GRBs.  
NICER will continue to monitor this source. Multi-wavelength followup observations are strongly encouraged.

We report the classification of SN 2022nwx as a Type Ib supernova a few days before peak luminosity. The spectroscopic observation was carried out with LRIS on the Keck-I 10 m telescope on UTC 2022-07-01 12:35 / MJD 59761.524. The transient was flagged and supplied by ANTARES (antares.noao.edu) using the discovery stream from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF; Bellm et al., 2019, PASP, 131, 018002) on 2022-06-29 10:42 with the last nondetection on 2022-06-21 10:47. Using the Supernova Identification code (SNID; Blondin & Tonry 2007, ApJ, 666, 1024), the spectrum of SN 2022nwx shows a good match with the Type Ib SN 1999ex at day -5, and the associated redshift estimated for SN 2022nwx is 0.027Â±0.007. Cross-correlation adopting GELATO (Harutyunyan et al. 2008, A&Ap, 488, 383; https://gelato.tng.iac.es) also suggests that SN 2022nwx is consistent with the spectrum of the Type Ib SN 2007C at -5.9 days relative to its V-band peak luminosity, with a redshift estimate of SN 2022nwx of 0.02Â±0.003. 
 
 
 
We report the classification of SN 2022nyu as a young Type IIP supernova a few days after the explosion. The Keck-I LRIS spectrum was obtained on UTC 2022-07-01 14:47 / MJD 29761.616. The transient was reported by the ATLAS survey (Tonry et al. 2011, PASP, 123, 58) on 2022-06-29 13:45 with the last nondetection on 2022-06-28 14:16. Cross-correlations using SNID and GELATO suggest that the LRIS spectrum of SN 2022nyu matches the spectra of Type IIP SN 2005cs at 4 days and Type IIP SN 1995ad at 11.9 days after the explosion. The redshift determined from the narrow H-alpha emission yields 0.0613Â±0.0003. 
 
 
 
We do not find any convincing match to the spectrum of AT 2022nuh, which is a transient reported by ALeRCE using the discovery stream from ZTF at 2022-06-28 09:56 with the last nondetection at 2022-06-28 10:12. The LRIS spectrum of AT 2022nuh was obtained on UTC 2022-07-01 14:57 / MJD 59761.623. It marginally matches the spectrum of the Type Ib SN 2008D at -15.8 days relatively to the B-band peak luminosity and a redshift of 0.09Â±0.002 according to GELATO cross-correlation. A reddening E(B-V) ~ 0.2 mag is suggested by the matching process."

We report the detection of a supernova candidate in a galaxy at redshift z=1.76 that is multiply imaged by foreground RX J1347-1145 (z=0.451) galaxy cluster.   We found the transient, which should have a magnification of ~4, in imaging taken by the Hubble Space Telescope SNAP GO-16279 program, which is searching for microlensing events of high-redshift magnified stars. In a visit to the field on May 30th, we detect a source with F110W = 25.8+-0.3 mag, with no detection in F606W.  No transient is detected in imaging from a previous visit to the field by the program on May 18th.  The SN may reappear in ~9.5 years in a pair of highly magnified images of its host galaxy, if it is located in the multiply imaged region of the galaxy. An HST Directorâs Discretionary program has been approved to measure its light curve, and acquire WFC IR G102 grism spectroscopy. If a Type Ia SN with minimal extinction, it should reach a peak AB magnitude of F110W~23.8 in early July.

Swift-XRT has reobserved the candidate Tidal Disruption Event Swift J023017.0+283603 (ATEL #15454) for 4 ks on 2022 June 22, between 16:07 UT and 19:25 UT. Using these new data we derive an enhanced position (using UVOT data to correct the astrometry) of RA,Dec = 37.57140, 28.60124 degrees, which is equivalent to

RA (J2000) =  02h 30m 17.14s  
Dec(J2000) = +28d 36m 04.5s

with an uncertainty of 2.7"" (radius, 90% confidence). This is 0.25"" away from 2MASX J02301709+2836050, which has a photometric redshift of 0.03997 (NED / 2MPZ catalogue: Bilicki et al., 2014, ApJS, 210, 9).

We have fitted the X-ray spectrum with a diskbb model in xspec, with a Galactic absorber with NH = 1.12 x 10^21 cm^-2 (Willingale et al., 2013) and a second absorber at z=0.03997. The best-fitting inner disk temperature is 121 (+13,-25) eV, with an intrinsic column density of <1.1 x 10^21 cm^-2. The 0.3-10 keV fitted flux is (7.5 +/- 1.2) x 10^-13 erg cm^-2 s. Assuming a redshift of 0.03997 = 174 Mpc, this corresponds to L = (2.8 +/- 0.4) x 10^42 erg s^-1. These parameters are consistent with expected TDE properties.

The two observations taken so far are too close in time to assess variability, although future observations are scheduled. Swift has observed this location 11 times prior to the transient detection; the most recent of these observations occurred on 2022 January 08, and showed no X-rays near the source location in 900 s of exposure, thus we can constrain the outburst start time to between January 8th and June 22nd (of 2022).

Unfortunately, in about half of the previous observations, the location of Swift J023017.0+283603 was outside the UVOT field of view, with the most recent UVOT observation covering the source being on 2021 December 24. The host galaxy is clearly visible in all UVOT filters, but shows no evidence for an increase in brightness since 2021 December 24 and 2022 June 22."

Given the proximity to a galaxy and the soft spectrum, this is a candidate Tidal Disruption Event.

Follow-up observations are strongly encouraged.

This transient was found as part of a new system to automatically check for serendipitous transients in Swift-XRT data."

We report on recent high-resolution very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations of the changing-look AGN 1ES 1927+654 (z=0.017). The All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN) first reported an optical flare from the nuclear region of 1ES 1927+654 on 2018-03-03 (ATel #11391, Nicholls et al., 2018); this was accompanied by the emergence of broad Balmer lines in the optical spectrum (Trakhtenbrot et al., 2019) rendering a changing-look AGN (from Type 2 to Type 1). The Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) observations of 1ES 1927+654 (on 2018-05-22) found an extremely soft X-ray spectrum and a continued decrease in the X-ray luminosity (ATel #12169, Kara et al., 2018) compared to archival data. This was followed by a NICER detection of increased X-ray luminosity beyond 1st July (ATel #12169, Kara et al., 2018) -- 4 months after the optical outburst. The dense optical/UV and X-ray monitoring observations (Trakhtenbrot et al., 2019; Ricci et al., 2021) support the changing-look nature of 1ES 1927+654. 
 
We have been monitoring this source in the radio band for ~ 5 years (Yang et al. In preparation) since 2018. The observations reveal a relatively faint radio emitting source with a flux density of 3 - 6 mJy between 2018 and March 2021. Our most recent target of opportunity European VLBI Network (EVN) observations of 1ES 1927+654 at 5 GHz were conducted on 23 October 2021 (from 15:00 to 19:00 UT); 14 telescopes participated in this observation. The target was phase-referenced to the nearby source J1933+6540 (RA: 19:33:57.3373, DEC: +65:40:16.828, J2000), which is 0.69 degrees away. The EVN data were correlated on 26 March 2022 at JIVE. Preliminary analysis indicates that the target is slightly resolved in this observation, just under a beam size of 3.31 * 1.32 milli-arcsec and has a peak at RA: 19:27:19.5400, DEC: +65:33:54.336 (J2000). The observation yielded a 5 GHz total flux density of 8.4+-0.3 mJy, two times higher than the 5 GHz VLBA observation on 15 March 2021, which is 4.04 +- 0.15 mJy (Yang et al. In preparation). It indicates the source has entered a brightening phase in the radio band. We calibrated additional data and confirmed the long-term radio flare activity. The increase of radio flux density follows the most recent optical and X-ray flares by ~700 and ~450 days, respectively. Further radio observations have been planned; we encourage multi-band follow-up observations during this opportune phase. 
 
We thank the EVN Program Committee Chair, Zsolt Paragi for supporting our ToO observation. We thank the Head of Science Operations, Bob Campbell, and the EVN Scheduler, Alastair Gunn for making this observation possible. The participating telescopes were Badary, Effelsberg, Irbene, Jodrell Bank, Kunming, Medicina, Onsala, Shanghai, Svetloe, Torun, Urumqi, Westerbork, Yebes and Zelenchukskaya.

AT2022cmc/ZTF22aaajecp is a fast red optical transient discovered by the Zwicky Transient Factory on Feb. 11, 2022 (Andreoni et al. 2022, GCN #31590), lying at a redshift of z = 1.19 (Tanvir et al. GCN #31602). AT2022cmc was identified as a candidate relativistic tidal disruption event (Pasham et al., ATEL#15232) and has been observed to exhibit variations in the soft and hard X-ray bands (Yao et al, ATEL#15230). To further investigate the late time evolution of this source, we examined observations of AT2022cmc obtained by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, X-Ray Telescope (XRT).

Source counts are extracted from a 20 arcsec radius circle centered on the source position, with background extracted from a neighboring source-free region. In a 12.5 ks observation sequence on March 19th, after rebinning utilizing a bin size of 1ks, the X-ray light curve shows an average count rate of ~ 0.01 ct/s (see table) with significant variability.  In the observing sequence, the count rate peaked at 0.0347 +- 0.0076 ct/s, and had a minimum value of 0.0067 +- 0.0038 ct/s. This confirms the continued presence of hourly variations (e.g., Atel #15230).  Further observations have revealed continuing flux variability at X-ray energies.

We also examined the UVOT data obtained simultaneously with the X-ray data above. Utilizing a 5 arcsec extraction region, the source is not detected in individual UV exposures in the M2 filter. We stacked frames of um2 filter together (March 23rd - April 9th) and found statistically significant emission at the source position in the resulting 2.8ks exposure, with um2 AB magnitude of um2 = 22.17 +/- 0.19(stat) +/- 0.03(sys) mag. There is no statistically significant evidence for the evolution of the UV flux at the current time."

We report the detection of a bright fast radio burst with the Tianlai Cylinder Pathfinder Array. We have been carrying out a blind FRB search with our 96 beam backend in the frequency range of 700-800 MHz. The data stream is recorded with a sampling time of 98.304 microseconds for 1024 frequency channels.  
 
A bright burst was detected with a S/N~15 for ~2.2 ms duration at UT 17:26:40.368, April 14 2022 (MJD 59684.06018945136). An early estimate of the burst's peak flux is 128.4(\pm 10%) Jy and fluence is 204.0(\pm 10%) Jy ms. The burst has a best estimate of dispersion measure DM = 208.1\pm 0.5 pc cm^{-3}. The DM contributed by Milky Way in this direction is ~27 pc cm^{-3} (NE2001). Thus the DM-inferred redshift has an upper limit of z ~ 0.24. The J2000 coordinate of the burst is estimated to be RA = 13h04m21s(\pm 2m12s), DEC = +48\deg18'05""(\pm 10'19""). 
 
The Tianlai Cylinder Pathfinder Array is a radio interferometer located in Xinjiang, China(Li, et al. 2020), and operated by the National Astronomical Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences (NAOC). In December 2021, a FRB backend that is capable to form 96 beams and process data in real-time is installed. Since then, we carry out a blind FRB search operating in drift mode.

Subjects: Ultra-Violet, X-ray, Transient, Tidal Disruption Event

AT2018fyk/ASASSN-18ul is a nuclear transient identified in the optical by the ASASSN survey on 8 September 2018 (Wevers et al. 2019). Based on a quiescent host galaxy Magellan spectrum and the lack of optical variability between 2014-2018, i.e., in the four years prior to the ASASSN detection, the source was classified as a stellar tidal disruption event (Wevers et al. 2019). The multi-wavelength datasets acquired between September 2018 and June 2020 support the TDE hypothesis (Wevers et al. 2021). The outburst reached a peak X-ray luminosity of (1.1+-0.1)e44 erg/s around July 2019 and eventually became undetectable with Chandra with a 0.3-10 keV luminosity upper limit of 1.5e40 erg/s on 29 June 2020 (Wevers et al. 2021).

Recent Neil Gehrels Swift XRT observations taken between January-April 2022 reveal a bright point source with a mean 0.3-8 keV count rate of 0.012+-0.001 cps. In these recent X-ray data, AT2018fyk is variable over days with count rates varying between 0.01 cps and 0.03 cps. A combined 0.3-8 keV energy spectral analysis of data taken between 24 March and 6 April 2022 (145 counts in total) is well fit with a powerlaw model (tbabs*zashift(pow) in XSPEC), yielding a c-stat/degree of freedom of 18.3/29. The column density of tbabs was fixed at the Galactic value in the source direction of 1.1e20 cm^-2. The best-fit power-law index is 2.6(+0.3,-0.2). The 0.3-8 keV observed flux is (3.9+-0.4)e-13 erg/s/cm^2. The corresponding unabsorbed flux and luminosity values are (4.9+-0.7)e-13 erg/s/cm^2 and (4.2+-0.6)e42 erg/s, respectively. These numbers imply that the source has brightened by more than a factor of 220 in X-rays since 29 June 2020.  A thermal disk model (tbabs*zashift(diskbb) in XSPEC) gives a poor fit with c-stat/dof of 66/29. Concurrently, the UV emission, as inferred from the UVW1 filter data on Swift/UVOT, has increased by a factor of a few: from 7e41 erg/s during the last X-ray non-detection to 6e42 in the most recent data.

Such a re-brightening of a previously X-ray and UV bright TDE years after initial discovery has never been seen. At present, there is limited data to make a conclusive statement about the cause of this unprecedented X-ray and UV rebrightening, but we speculate that this could be due to an inner accretion disk instability predicted from theory (e.g., Shen and Matzner 2014), a repeating partial disruption event similar to ASASSN-14ko (e.g., Payne et al. 2021) and HLX-1 (Lasoto et al. 2011; Godet et al. 2014) but with a ~2 year stellar orbital period,  or even a supermassive black hole binary (e.g., Coughlin et al. 2017). Variable obscuration seems unlikely here,  because the UV emission remained above host galaxy levels during the previous Chandra X-ray upper limit measurement from 29 June 2020 (Wevers et al. 2021).

Follow-up observations with NICER and Swift are planned.  A weekly updated NICER schedule can be found here: https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/nicer/schedule/nicer_sts_current.html. To coordinate multiwavelength observations, please contact drreddy@mit.edu.

The NUTS2 collaboration (Holmbo et al. 2019; ATel #12661) reports the spectroscopic classification of SN 2022gnp (ZTF22aadoihx) in Arp 299 at z = 0.0104 (NED). The candidate was discovered by ZTF.

The observation was performed with the 2.56 m Nordic Optical Telescope equipped with ALFOSC on 2022-04-10.14 UT (range 340-980 nm; resolution 1.3 nm).

(1) The spectrum shows prominent He I features, and is that of a Type Ib supernova. The spectrum is red in colour and shows a strong narrow Na I D absorption feature (EW ~ 3.5 Å) at the host-galaxy redshift, indicating the transient is subject to substantial host-galaxy extinction. With reddening of E(B-V) = 0.8, GELATO (Harutyunyan et al. 2008, A&A, 488, 383) finds a good match for SN 2005hg around peak."

We report the discovery of late-time radio emission from the TDE AT2018hyz. AT2018hyz was discovered by the ASAS-SN project at optical wavelengths on 06 Nov 2018 (Brimacombe  et al.; ATel #12194; TNS report 24133) and later classified as a TDE at a redshift of z=0.047 (Dong et al. ATel #12218). As part of the pilot phase of the Variable And Slow Transients survey (VAST; Murphy et al. 2021) on the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), the position of AT2018hyz was observed multiple times.  
Multiple observations during 2019 and 2020 resulted in non-detections. Radio emission was finally detected on 22 July 2021 at a flux density level of 1.3 +/- 0.3 mJy at a frequency of 0.89 GHz. 
Following this detection we have triggered multiple followup observations using several radio observatories.

Properties of the supernovae, as well as associated finding charts showing the archival imaging (left) and the follow-up confirmation image (right) are included in the table below:

Follow-up observations are encouraged.

While we are participating in the TNS system to minimize potential confusion, ASAS-SN will continue using ASASSN-22xx transient names as our primary nomenclature (including supernovae, but also other classes of transients), and we encourage others to do the same. We prefer merging the names as ASASSN-22xx (AT 2022xyz) to preserve, rather than anonymize, the origin of the transient.

We would like to thank Las Cumbres Observatory and its staff for their continued support of ASAS-SN.

We report radio observations of the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2022dsb taken with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). AT2022dsb was  first reported as a new optical transient ASASSN-22cs on 2022 March 1 (TNS  Astronomical Transient Report No. 138375) associated with the galaxy ESO 583- G 004, and later classified as a TDE at a redshift of z=0.023 by ePESSTO+ (TNS  Astronomical Transient Report No. 12024). Liu et al. reported the detection of a soft X-ray transient by SRG/eROSITA on 2022 February 17 coincident with the optical position of the source (ATel #15259), as well as an optical spectrum taken with the FLOYDS spectrograph mounted at the LCOGT 2m telescope at Haleakala Observatory on 2022 February 26 that showed broad H alpha and He II emission lines. These X-ray and optical spectral properties further confirmed the TDE nature of the transient.

We observed the optical position of the source on 2022 March 21 UT 21:30 with ATCA at 4cm (central frequencies of 5.5 and 9.0 GHz) using 2 GHz of bandwidth at each central frequency, in the 64 MHz mode. We reduced the data using standard procedures in the Common Astronomy Software Application, including flux calibration with PKS 1934-638 and phase calibration with PKS 1514-241.  We detected a point source in both observing bands at J2000 RA 15:42:21.7, Dec -22:40:14.3 with a positional uncertainty of 0.35 arcseconds along the major axis with a position angle of 58 degrees; coincident with the location of the host galaxy. We measure a flux density of 593+/-19 microJy at 5.5 GHz and 536+/-17 microJy at 9 GHz. Further radio observations have been requested to constrain the spectral shape of this transient. We encourage additional multi-wavelength follow up of this interesting source.

We thank the ATCA Observatory staff for enabling these triggered observations. We acknowledge the Gomeroi people as the traditional owners of the ATCA Observatory site."

We report the detection of three bright bursts from the repeating FRB 20201124A with the Nanshan 26-m (NSRT) radio telescope operated by Xinjiang Astronomical Observatory (XAO). The three bursts occurred on 28th February,17th March, and 19th March 2022 respectively. The observation were made at L-band  with central frequency of 1556.0 MHz and bandwidth of 320 MHz. The average system temperature is 25K. A pulsar backend developed by XAO based on ROACH2, XAO Filter Bank (XFB), is used for recording the data. 
 
We used the software package BEAR (Men et al., 2019) and the dispersed dynamic spectra search pipeline based on the deep learning to search for the radio pulse. All the bursts detected with NSRT had peak flux higher than 4 Jy and the total isotropic energy is higher than 3e38 ergs. The total isotropic energy, luminosity, and peak flux of the burst with highest S/N are 2e39 ergs, 3e41 ergs/s, and 10 Jy, respectively. The DM we measured agrees with the previous report (Xu et al. 2022). We note that a burst we detected on 17th March 2022 agrees with the FAST detection (Atel #15288), where the NSRT site time-of-arrival is MJD 59655.42544918 after correcting the DM delay to the infinite frequency with DM=410 pc cm^-3. The pulse shape and search plots are given in the attached figure. 
 
Our detection of bright pulses from FRB 20201124A are close to, if not higher than, the previous reported maximal value of ~1E39 erg (Xu et al., 2022), which may indicate that FRB 20201124 is now in an active and energetic state. We encourage other telescopes to perform follow-up observation towards the FRB 20201124A.

We have been carrying out daily to weekly monitoring of FRB 20201124A (RA = 05h08m03.459s, DEC = +26d03m39.14s)[1] with the central beam of the FAST L-band 19 beam receiver in the frequency range of 1.0-1.5 GHz, and the data stream was recorded with a sampling time of 49.152 μs for 4096 frequency channels. In addition to the bursts from an active episode between April and June, 2021[2], more than three thousand bursts have been detected in 25 observing hours since February 2022.  A bright burst was detected with a peak S/N∼150 for 2.8 ms duration at an arrival time of UT 10:12:38.85488, March 17 2022, i.e. 59655.4254277447 MJD (correcting to solar system barycenter with an infinite frequency). The flux and polarization of the burst was calibrated with noise CAL injection. The burst is nearly 100% linearly polarized with a RM = -673 rad/m2, a best estimate of dispersion measure DM = 410.9±0.5 pc cm-3. A few digital samples are saturated in the 8-bit system, resulting in the lower limit of peak flux density of 367±2 mJy (corresponding to an isotropic peak luminosity (1.03±0.06)x1041 erg/s).

FRB 20201124A stays active. We encourage more target-of-opportunity observations with multi-band facilities. FAST is a Chinese national mega-science facility, built and operated by the National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences (NAOC). We appreciate all the members in the FAST FRB key science project collaboration for their support and assistance during the observations.

The spectrum is similar to the Ia-csm/IIn event at the early phase, e.g., SN 2005gj = 12d after the explosion via Gelato (Harutyunyan et al. 2008) or SN 2005gj = -12d before the peak via SNID (Blondin & Tonry 2007). 
The photometric analysis matches the spectroscopic result. AT 2022erq was discovered at about 18.1 mag with ATLAS-cyan band on Mar. 11.6. The photometry obtained by LJT on Mar. 12.9 (g = 17.43 \pm 0.02, r = 17.51\pm 0.01, i = 17.62 \pm 0.02) shows a fast-rising of this transient. Given the redshift z = 0.066 (from the H-Balmer emissions), the absolute magnitude of 2022erq is close to -20mag during LJT observation without reddening correction. The fast-rising and high luminosity consistent the light curve of SN 2005gj a few days before the peak."

We report on the X-ray detection from SRG/eROSITA (Predehl et al. A&A 647, A1, 2021) of the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2022dsb. AT2022dsb was reported as a new optical transient ASASSN-22cs on 2022 March 1st, (TNS Astronomical Transient Report No. 138375), and was spectroscopically classified as a TDE at a redshift of z=0.023 by ePESSTO+ (TNS Classification Report No. 12024).

AT2022dsb was in the Field-of-View of eROSITA during the fifth consecutive all-sky survey (eRASS5) on 2022 February 17th, 11 days before the ASASSN TNS report. The source was discovered as a new soft X-ray nuclear transient eRASSt J154221.7-224013.0 in eRASS5 with a total exposure time of ~239s and total photon counts of 36 in the 0.2-2.3keV energy band. An optical spectrum was obtained with the FLOYDS spectrograph mounted at the LCOGT 2m telescope at Haleakala Observatory on February 26th. In agreement with the TNS Classification Report (No. 12024), the spectrum shows broad Halpha and prominent HeII 4685 in emission.

Assuming an absorbed blackbody model, with equivalent hydrogen column density fixed to N_H=1.7x10^21 cm^-2 (Willingale et al., 2013, MNRAS, 431, 394), we derived a best-fitting blackbody temperature of 45+-10eV with observed 0.2-2.3keV flux of 3.3+-1.1E-13 erg/s/cm^2 (~4.2E41 erg/s). AT2022dsb was not detected in all four previous eROSITA all-sky surveys. Using the best-fitting model from eRASS5, we derived a 3 sigma 0.2-2.3keV flux upper limit of 5.0E-14 erg/s/cm^2 combing all the previous four eRASS data which has a total exposure of 978s. Additional XMM, NICER and Swift observations have been requested to continue monitoring the X-ray/ UV evolution of this TDE candidate."

The young core-collapse supernova SN 2022crv (=DLT22d, ATLAS22gdi) in NGC 3054, originally classified as a type Ib event, has been observed with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) at 5.5 and 9.0 GHz on 1 March 2022 09:00-13:00 UT. Clear radio emission was detected at the reported location, with flux densities of 0.7 mJy and 0.5 mJy at 9.0 and 5.5 GHz respectively, suggesting the radio emission may be yet to peak at these frequencies. Adopting a host galaxy distance of 34 Mpc from the NASA Extragalactic Database (NED) this implies a 5.5 GHz luminosity 10 days after discovery of 7E+26 erg/sec/Hz. We would like to extend our thanks to the ATCA staff for enabling these observations.

While we are participating in the TNS system to minimize potential confusion, ASAS-SN will continue using ASASSN-22xx transient names as our primary nomenclature (including supernovae, but also other classes of transients), and we encourage others to do the same. We prefer merging the names as ASASSN-22xx (AT 2022xyz) to preserve, rather than anonymize, the origin of the transient.

We would like to thank Las Cumbres Observatory and its staff for their continued support of ASAS-SN.

The IceCube Collaboration (http://icecube.wisc.edu/) reports: 
 
IceCube has performed a search for track-like muon neutrino events arriving from the direction of the candidate relativistic tidal disruption event AT2022cmc/ZTF22aaajecpc (ATel #15232) which was originally identified as a fast red transient by ZTF (https://www.wis-tns.org/object/2022cmc).  
 
The search was performed using a time window approximately twelve days in duration, beginning at the time of the first ZTF detection (2022-02-11 10:42:40.32 UTC to 2022-02-23 23:00:00.00 UTC), during which IceCube was collecting good quality data.  
 
We find that the data are consistent with atmospheric background expectations, with a p-value of 1. We accordingly derive a time-integrated muon-neutrino flux upper limit for this source of E^2 dN/ dE = 5.7 x 10^-5 TeV cm^-2 at 90% CL, under the assumption of an E^-2 power law. 90% of events IceCube would detect from a source at this declination with an E^-2 spectrum have energies in the approximate energy range between 700 GeV and 500 TeV.

NICER observed the rapidly fading transient AT2022cva (Ho et al. GCN 31619) for 2.4 ks starting at 2022-02-21T22:56:03. X-rays are clearly detected above the background in the 0.3-5.0 keV band with a mean background-subtracted count rate of 0.92+-0.02 counts/seconds. We fit the 0.3-5 keV X-ray spectrum with a redshifted powerlaw modified by neutral absorption in Milkway and host galaxy  (tbabs*ztbabs*zpow in XSPEC). Using a Galactic nH value for tbabs (0.023e22 cm^2; HI4PI Collaboration, Bekhti et al. 2016) and a redshift of 0.293 (Fremling et al., GCN 31619) gives a good fit with a c-stat/degrees of freedom of 57/57. The best-fit power law index and host column density values are 1.36(+0.14,-0.12) and <5e20 cm^-2, respectively. The 0.3-5 keV observed flux is (2.24+-0.07)e-12 erg/s/cm^2. This corresponds to an observed luminosity of 5.04(+0.03,-0.33)e44 erg/s at a redshift of 0.293, which is typical for a GRB afterglow at a similar phase.

NICER can carry out prompt follow-up observations of transients and is planning to systematically follow up alerts from LIGO/Virgo and other X-ray bright extra-galactic transients in the future.

AT2022cmc/ZTF22aaajecp was identified by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) on 11 February 2022 10:42:40 UT as a fast and red transient (Andreoni et al, GCN 31590). A follow-up optical spectrum taken roughly six days after discovery revealed its redshift to be 1.193 (Tanvir et al, GCN 31602). This was independently confirmed by Lundquist et al. GCN 31612 using Keck observations on 17 February 2022. AT2022cmc has several intriguing properties including rapidly fading optical emission and red optical color (Pankov et al., GCN 31593; Perley et al., GCN 31594; Kumar et al., GCN 31597), luminous radio emission (Perley et al. GCN 31592) and an extremely luminous and long-lived (compared to GRB afterglows) X-ray emission (Pasham et al., GCN 31601).

Encouraged by NICER detection of strong X-ray emission on 16 February 2022 (Pasham et al., GCN 31601) we continued to perform high-cadence monitoring observations (one visit every few hours)  through 21 February 2022. Here we report on data collected until 19 February. NICER detected the source all throughout between 0.3-6 keV with an observed 0.3-6 keV count rate varying between 3.3 and 15.6 counts/sec. While the X-ray emission is variable on hours timescale the overall observed 0.3-6 keV flux [luminosity] decreased from a mean value of 3.19(+0.02,-0.02)E-11 erg/s/cm^2 [1.52(+0.01,-0.01)E47 erg/s] on 16 Feb to 8.66(+0.11,-0.13)E-12 erg/s/cm^2 [4.68(+0.05,-0.05)E46 erg/s] on 19 February. The best-fit unabsorbed 0.3-6 keV luminosities on the 16th and 19th were (6.2+-0.2)E47 erg/s and (2.3+-0.1)E47 erg/s, respectively.

We divided the NICER data on a per day basis and extracted four spectra corresponding to 16 through 19 February 2022. All the spectra can be well-fit with a powerlaw modified by Galactic and host absorption. The X-ray spectral powerlaw index is variable with time and appears to be anticorrelated with the observed luminosity, i.e., the powerlaw index has a higher value at lower fluxes. Interestingly, this is similar to the behavior of the relativistic tidal disruption event SwJ1644+57 (e.g., Burrows et al., 2011), but atypical for GRB afterglows.

Based on hours timescale variability in both soft (0.3-6 keV) and hard (3-30 keV) X-rays (Yao et al., ATEL#15230) and spectral variations, we suggest that AT2022cmc may be an analog of SwJ1644+57. This would make it the first relativistic TDE identified in more than a decade. Further panchromatic monitoring is necessary for a robust classification. We strongly encourage multi-wavelength observations of this extreme event especially at radio and high energies.

NICER is planning to continue to monitor AT2022cmc as part of a GO program from cycle 3 (PI: Pasham) and with additional DDT observations.

AT2022cmc/ZTF22aaajecp is a fast and red optical transient discovered by ZTF (Andreoni et al, GCN 31590) at a redshift of 1.193 (Tanvir et al, GCN 31602; Lundquist et al. GCN 31612). Hereafter we use t to denote rest-frame time since the first ZTF detection (i.e., 2022-02-11T10:42:40). 
The observed 0.3--6 keV X-ray luminosity at t = 2.44 days is 2.46 +/- 0.04 E+47 erg/s (Pasham et al, GCN 31601), making this object much brighter than the brightest GRB afterglow at a similar phase (see, e.g., Figure 5 of Margutti et al. 2019, ApJ, 872, 18). Its X-ray luminosity is comparable to the jetted tidal disruption event (TDE) Swift J1644 at a similar phase.  
A NuSTAR ToO observation of AT2022cmc was triggered under our Cycle-7 GO program (proposal 07112; PI Yao). The observation was conducted from 2022-02-18T18:15:14 to 2022-02-19T18:35:00 (i.e., t = 3.34--3.80 days), with an on-source time of 47.9 ks. Hour-timescale variability was observed. The 3--30 keV source net count rate (FPMA+FPMB) varied between 0.08 +/- 0.01 cnt/s and 0.43 +/- 0.05 cnt/s. The trend of flux evolution agrees with simultaneous NICER (0.3--6 keV) observations (Pasham et al., ATel, in prep). 
We first modeled the 3--30 keV NuSTAR spectrum using tbabs*ztbabs*zashift*powerlaw, with the column density nH in tbabs fixed at the Galactic value of 8.88 E+19 cm^-2 (HI4PI Collaboration et al. 2016). This gives a good fit with a chi-square/degrees of freedom (chi2/dof) of 179/161. The best-fit power law index Gamma = 2.06 +/- 0.07, and host galaxy nH = 11.9 +/- 5.2 E+22 cm^-2. However, we note that the best-fit Gamma is significantly greater than the photon index obtained from NICER spectral fitting (Pasham et al, ATel in prep). 
Next, we produced a NICER spectrum using events within the NuSTAR time window of a longer monitoring campaign (Pasham et al., ATel, in prep). We jointly fit the 3--30 keV NuSTAR and 0.3--5 keV NICER spectra with a broken power-law tbabs*ztbabs*zashift*bknpower. The best-fit model has chi2/dof = 279/230. The rest-frame energy break point is at E_bk = 11.1 +/- 1.6 keV (i.e., 5.1 +/- 0.7 keV in observer-frame). The photon index at EE_bk is Gamma_2 = 1.99 +/- 0.06. The host galaxy nH = 6.4 +/- 1.7 E+20 cm^-2. The 0.3--30 keV observed flux = 1.47+/-0.02 E-11 erg/s/cm^2.  
If AT2022cmc belongs to the class of relativistic TDEs, it will be the first such member uncovered in over a decade. Further multi-wavelength observations are strongly encouraged."

The observation was performed with the 2.56 m Nordic Optical Telescope equipped with ALFOSC on 2022-02-13.93 UT (range 340-980 nm; resolution 1.3 nm).

(1) The noisy spectrum shows a relatively red continuum. A narrow absorption at 487.3 nm (with FWHM ~ 1300 km/s) is visible, while other features are not clearly detected. The object presents a g-r ~ 0.4-0.5 (from ZTF) and a decrease of ~0.5 mag in the last two days. Given the overall properties, we rule out that AT2021ybe is a supernova. Tentatively, we suggest that AT2021ybe could be a blazar at a z~0.742 if the narrow blue absorption matches with the Mg II (279.63, 280.35 nm) doublet. A Galactic reddening of E(B-V) = 0.20 is derived from Schlafly & Finkbeiner 2011, ApJ, 737, 103."

We report an update on the Swift and NICER observations of AT2021ehb/ZTF21aanxhjv --- a nearby tidal disruption event (TDE) at z=0.018 discovered by ZTF (Gezari et al. 2021).  
 
X-rays from AT2021ehb were first detected by Swift/XRT on July 1 2021 (Yao et al. 2021). Ever since then, Swift had been observing this object with a cadence of 5--7 days, until the observatory entered into a safe mode on January 18 2022 (Cenko 2022). The 0.3--10 keV XRT spectra can be well described by a combination of multi-color disk and power-law. Throughout the XRT monitoring campaign, the hydrogen column density was consistent with the Galactic value of 9.97 E+20 cm^-2. From July 2021 to January 2022, the observed 0.3--10 keV luminosity increased from 3.1+/-0.8 E+41 erg/s to 3.5+/-0.5 E+43 erg/s. A gradual X-ray spectral hardening was clearly captured --- the fractional contribution of the power-law component with respect to the total observed 0.3--10 keV flux (hereafter defined as f_PL) increased from 35+/-6 % to 90+/-5 %, and the power-law photon index Gamma decreased from 3+/-0.3 to 2+/-0.3.  
 
High-cadence X-ray observations with NICER were initiated on November 13 2021. Short-timescale (minutes to hours) variability with an amplitude of 1.2--2 was observed. In all GTI-binned NICER data, the 0.3--4 keV energy spectra can be described with the same continuum model as adopted in XRT. From November 13 to November 30 2021, the inferred observed 0.3--10 keV luminosity stayed at 8+/-2 E+42 erg/s. The luminosity rose to 1.3+/-0.5 E+43 erg/s around November 31 2021, and then further rose to 3.5+/-0.5 E+43 erg/s around December 25 2021. The X-ray brightening can be attributed to an increase of the power-law normalization factor (with f_PL increased from 78+/-5 % to 90+/-4 %) and an increase of the inner disk temperature (from 200+/-10 eV to 240+/-6 eV).  
 
On January 19 2022, NICER caught a drastic decrease in X-ray flux, which was accompanied by a spectral softening. From January 19 to February 8 2022, the inferred observed 0.3--10 keV luminosity stayed around 2.5 E+42 erg/s, with T_in=146+/-4 eV, f_PL=68+/-5 %, and Gamma=2.6+/-0.1.  
 
The X-ray spectral evolution of AT2021ehb before January 19 2022 was reminiscent of the soft-to-hard state transition seen in AT2018fyk (Wevers et al. 2021), while the recent detection of the late-time transition to a much softer state is novel for a TDE.   
 
We note that AT2021ehb is the third nearest optically-selected TDE (after iPTF16fnl and AT2019qiz , both of which are faint in the X-ray; see Table 1 of Gezari 2021). As such it provides a unique opportunity to study a TDE with high signal-to-noise observations. For example, a previous Chandra/LETG observation showed evidence of a relativistic outflow (Miller et al. 2022a), and the recent XMM-Newton/EPIC observation showed interesting features in the Fe K band (Miller et al. 2022b). Future high-cadence multi-wavelength observations of this object are encouraged to capture the entire evolution, and to reveal the inner workings of this TDE.  
 
NICER is a 0.25--12 keV X-ray telescope operating on the International Space Station. The NICER mission and portions of the NICER science team activities are funded by NASA.
